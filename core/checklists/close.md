# Close Stage Checklist

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Sustain complete or explicit decision to end
- [ ] Work is ready to retire, archive, or conclude

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Learnings captured
- [ ] Next cycle seeded (if applicable)
- [ ] Artifacts archived or preserved
- [ ] Stakeholders notified (if applicable)

## Guidance

Close is about **ending work intentionally and capturing leverage**. This includes archiving artifacts, capturing learnings, retiring work, and seeding future cycles.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Capture what was learned
- Archive artifacts for future reference
- Document outcomes and impact
- Identify leverage for future work
- Close cleanly and intentionally

**Activities:**
- Retrospective or post-mortem
- Documentation of outcomes
- Archival of artifacts
- Knowledge transfer (if applicable)
- Seeding new Capture for follow-on work

**Critical Outputs:**
1. **Learnings Captured** — What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently?
2. **Artifacts Archived** — Code, documents, designs preserved
3. **Outcomes Documented** — Impact, metrics, results
4. **Leverage Identified** — What can be reused or built upon?

**What Close Is Not:**
- Abandonment without reflection
- Deletion without archiving
- Ending without learnings

## Close → Capture Loop

Close can seed new Capture for follow-on work:
- **Iteration 2.0:** Build on learnings to improve next version
- **Related Work:** Spin off adjacent problems discovered
- **Maintenance Handoff:** Transfer to long-term sustainment team

**The loop is intentional:** Close one thing, capture the next.

## Domain Variance

Close semantics vary by domain:
- **Code:** Archive repo, document impact, capture technical debt
- **Write/Create:** Publish final version, document reception, archive drafts
- **Learn:** Assess retention, document insights, plan practice
- **Observe:** Archive notes, synthesize themes, identify follow-up

## Progression

Close is the final stage. From here, you can:
- Start a new cycle (new Capture)
- Seed related work
- End completely

**Close completes the cycle.** You've captured, sensed, explored, shaped, formalized, committed, executed, sustained, and now you close with intention.
