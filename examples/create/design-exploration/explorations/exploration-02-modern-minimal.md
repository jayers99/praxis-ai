## Concept

Contemporary take on NYE celebration—clean, minimal, geometric shapes with restrained color palette.

---

## Visual Description

**Composition:**
- Asymmetric layout (dynamic, modern)
- Large numerals "2026" as primary visual element
- Minimal ornamentation, lots of negative space
- Champagne glass silhouette (simple line art, not ornate)

**Typography:**
- Sans serif only (Futura or similar geometric sans)
- Mix of weights (light for details, bold for headline)
- Lowercase event name (casual, approachable)

**Color:**
- Black background
- Gold accents (used sparingly, not dominant)
- White text (high contrast, modern)
- No burgundy (reduced palette)

**Ornamentation:**
- None—design relies on typography and layout
- Thin geometric lines for separation only
- Emphasis on whitespace and breathing room

## Strengths

- ✓ Contemporary, fresh feel
- ✓ Highly scalable to social media (minimal detail loss)
- ✓ Approachable, not intimidating
- ✓ Fast execution (fewer elements)

## Weaknesses

- ✗ Doesn't capture "speakeasy" vibe (too modern)
- ✗ Lacks warmth and vintage character
- ✗ May not differentiate from generic NYE graphics
- ✗ Doesn't leverage venue's vintage aesthetic

## Client Feedback (Sketch Review)

"Too clean for us. Our venue is all about vintage charm, this feels like a tech company party."

**Decision:** Not aligned with brand, explore option closer to vintage aesthetic
