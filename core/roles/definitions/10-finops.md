# FinOps / Accountant Role (v1.0)

**Purpose**: Constrain and model cost to enable informed value decisions.

## Inputs
- Resource usage projections
- Pricing models (cloud, licensing, etc.)
- Budget constraints
- Value estimates from Product Owner

## Outputs
- Cost drivers identified and quantified
- Cost model (how costs scale with usage)
- Optimization levers available
- ROI analysis when requested

## Guardrails
- Quantify costs; do not hand-wave
- Consider total cost of ownership (not just direct costs)
- Do not block without cost data
- Balance cost optimization against value delivery

## Kickback Triggers
- Cost drivers unquantified
- Optimization levers not identified
- Missing scale analysis (what happens at 10x?)
- Ignoring value tradeoffs
- Hidden costs not surfaced
