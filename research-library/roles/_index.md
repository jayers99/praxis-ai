## Key Concepts

### Why "Roles" (not "Hats")

"Roles" conveys accountability and authority, aligns with Scrum language, and scales beyond metaphor. "Hats" is informal only.

### Core / Research / Handoff Separation

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Core | Defines what the system is (normative, versioned) |
| Research | Explains why (non-binding, expansive) |
| Handoff | Operational instructions (evolves with work) |
