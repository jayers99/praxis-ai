# Sense — Themes Emerging

## Themes Identified (Light Organization)

### Theme 1: Technical Governance
**What it is:** How systems behave, technical controls, infrastructure

**Captures mentioning this:**
- HN thread: Monitoring, observability, logging
- Podcast: Continuous risk assessment, metrics
- Twitter thread: Transparency (log inputs/outputs/decisions)
- Meeting: Monitoring dashboards, rollback procedures

**Key patterns:**
- Monitoring/observability is foundational (not optional)
- Logging must be structured and queryable
- Rollback mechanisms are table stakes (< 5 min standard appearing)

---

### Theme 2: Organizational Governance
**What it is:** Who decides, decision rights, roles, escalation

**Captures mentioning this:**
- HN thread: Who has authority to override model?
- Research paper: Institutional structures, organizational processes
- Twitter thread: Accountability (humans own decisions, not algorithms)
- Meeting: Risk tiers, review boards, sign-offs

**Key patterns:**
- Clear decision rights matter (who can override AI?)
- Humans are responsible for outcomes (model is a tool)
- Blameless postmortems (learn from failures)

---

### Theme 3: Policy Governance
**What it is:** What's permitted, regulatory compliance, ethical frameworks

**Captures mentioning this:**
- Research paper: Policy frameworks, what's permitted
- Book excerpt: Standards for algorithms (higher, not lower)
- Meeting: Legal counsel concerns, liability, compliance

**Key patterns:**
- Algorithms should be held to higher standards (because of scale)
- Compliance is real constraint (can't ignore legal)
- Ethics and liability intersect (who's responsible when AI harms?)

## Cross-Cutting Concepts

### Concept: Transparency
- Appears in all three themes
- Technical: Log everything (inputs, outputs, models, decisions)
- Organizational: Audit trails, blameless postmortems
- Policy: Explainability as deployment gate

### Concept: Reversibility
- Technical: Fast rollback (< 5 min), version control
- Organizational: Decision authority to trigger rollback
- Policy: Right to be forgotten, reversal mechanisms

### Concept: Risk-Based Approach
- Not all AI decisions need same governance
- Low-risk = lightweight, high-risk = formal
- Risk assessment is continuous (not one-time)

## Observation (Still in Observe Domain)

These themes keep recurring across different sources. No thesis yet, just noticing patterns.
