# Explore Stage Checklist

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Sense complete; problem understood
- [ ] Problem or opportunity clearly articulated
- [ ] Context and inputs organized

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Multiple possibilities exist
- [ ] Can describe 2-3 viable directions
- [ ] Divergent thinking complete
- [ ] Tradeoffs between options identified

## Guidance

Explore is about **divergent thinking**—generating possibilities without obligation. Abandonment is expected and safe.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Generate multiple options without committing
- Think broadly and creatively
- Prototype, sketch, or experiment
- Evaluate feasibility of different approaches

**Activities:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Quick prototypes or sketches
- Research on different approaches
- "What if?" questioning
- Exploration of multiple paths

**Outputs:**
- 2-3 (or more) viable directions
- Rough understanding of each option
- Initial sense of tradeoffs
- Exploration artifacts (sketches, notes, prototypes)

**Critical Mindset:**
- **Low commitment:** Ideas are cheap, exploration is safe
- **Divergent:** Generate options, don't narrow yet
- **Playful:** Experiment freely
- **Reversible:** Everything can be discarded

**What Explore Is Not:**
- Convergent decision-making (that's Shape)
- Detailed planning (that's Formalize)
- Implementation (that's Execute)

## Progression

Once you have 2-3 viable directions and understand tradeoffs, advance to **Shape** to converge on a single direction.
