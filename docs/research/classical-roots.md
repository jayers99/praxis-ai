# Classical Roots of Praxis-AI

**Last updated:** 2025-12-28

The Praxis framework draws deeply from classical Greek philosophy. The name itself comes directly from Aristotle, and the framework's structure echoes concepts from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

## Aristotle — The Direct Source

The name "Praxis" comes directly from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*. Aristotle identified **three fundamental human activities**:

| Greek | Translation | In Praxis-AI |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Theoria** (θεωρία) | Contemplation/theory | Capture, Sense, Explore — "What is this?" |
| **Praxis** (πρᾶξις) | Action/practice | Execute, Sustain — "Do the work" |
| **Poiesis** (ποίησις) | Making/production | Formalize, Commit — "Create the artifact" |

### Key Aristotelian Concepts in Praxis

#### 1. Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)

Phronesis (φρόνησις) is the ability to deliberate well about what is good *in particular situations*. It is not abstract knowledge but knowing *what to do here, now*.

**Maps to:** The Policy Engine — deterministic resolution based on context:

```
Domain + Stage + Privacy + Environment → Behavior
```

This formula *is* phronesis operationalized: practical wisdom that resolves context-specific action from general principles.

#### 2. Eudaimonia (Flourishing)

Aristotle's goal was not just doing things but doing them *well* over time — living a flourishing life.

**Maps to:** The **Sustain** stage — active governance of living work, not just completion. Praxis asks: "Does this change alter the contract I formalized, or extend/refine its implementation?"

#### 3. Action as End, Not Means

In praxis (as opposed to poiesis), the activity itself is the goal. The outcome of virtuous action is the action itself, properly done.

**Maps to:** Praxis's emphasis on *durable intent* and *governance* over mere output volume. AI amplifies throughput; Praxis ensures that throughput serves coherent purpose.

### Primary Texts

- **Nicomachean Ethics** (Books VI, X) — Praxis vs. Theoria vs. Poiesis; Phronesis; virtue through action
- **Politics** — Governance, deliberation, collective action

## Plato — The Stages of Knowledge

Plato's **Divided Line** from the *Republic* maps remarkably well to Praxis's lifecycle:

| Plato's Stage | Greek | Description | Praxis Stage |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Eikasia** | Imagining | Shadows, reflections, illusion | **Capture** — raw inputs, unexamined |
| **Pistis** | Belief | Perceiving physical objects | **Sense, Explore** — making meaning |
| **Dianoia** | Reasoning | Mathematical/deductive thought | **Shape, Formalize** — structured planning |
| **Noesis** | True Knowledge | Direct apprehension of Forms | **Execute, Sustain** — verified, durable work |

### Key Platonic Concepts in Praxis

#### 1. Dialectic Method

The dialectical process: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis

**Maps to:** Iteration modes in Praxis:
- **Before Formalize (Discovery):** Iteration reshapes *what* you're building. Cheap to change.
- **After Formalize (Refinement):** Iteration improves *how well* you're building it. Scope is locked.

Praxis's phase gates create "dialectical moments" where ideas are tested and refined before progressing.

#### 2. The Allegory of the Cave

The journey from shadows to reality — from illusion through education to true understanding.

**Maps to:** The progression from **Capture** (shadows/raw inputs) through **Formalize** (structured understanding) to **Execute** (real work in real world).

Formalize is the "exit from the cave" — you commit to a concrete reality, leaving the shadows of undefined possibility.

#### 3. Theory of Forms

Perfect, unchanging ideals that exist behind imperfect material reality.

**Maps to:** **Opinions** in Praxis — timeless principles that guide but don't rigidly bind. From the Three-Layer Model:

```
Opinions → Governance → Execution
```

Opinions are the "Forms" that inform decisions without dictating them absolutely.

### Primary Texts

- **Republic** (Books VI-VII) — Divided Line, Allegory of the Cave, dialectic ascent through knowledge stages
- **Meno** — Learning as recollection; the process of coming to know

## Socrates — The Method of Questioning

Socrates's **Elenchus** (method of refutation through questioning) is embedded in Praxis's DNA.

| Socratic Concept | In Praxis |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Aporia** — puzzlement, recognizing ignorance | **Sense stage** — "I don't understand this yet" |
| **Question assumptions** | Stage gates that force explicit decisions |
| **"I know that I know nothing"** | Epistemic honesty in AI Guards — "distinguish belief from verification" |
| **Exposing contradictions** | **Validation model** — errors when artifacts contradict stage |

### Key Socratic Concepts in Praxis

#### 1. The Examined Life

> "The unexamined life is not worth living."

**Maps to:** The core problem Praxis solves — AI amplifies throughput, not coherence. Without examination (governance), you're "chasing your tail at higher speed," rediscovering rejected ideas, drifting scope mid-stream.

#### 2. Intellectual Humility

Claiming to know what you don't know is the greatest error. True wisdom begins with recognizing the limits of one's knowledge.

**Maps to:** Stage-appropriate behavior — you cannot "Execute" what you haven't "Formalized." Don't act on what you don't truly know. The Critical Rule: *No execution without formalization artifacts.*

#### 3. Virtue Through Practice

Wisdom isn't innate; it's developed through disciplined practice and repeated examination.

**Maps to:** The lifecycle itself — work progresses through stages, not jumps to completion. Each stage develops understanding incrementally.

### Primary Texts

- **Apology** — Defense of the examined life; intellectual humility
- **Euthyphro** — Method of definition; exposing confused concepts
- **Meno** — Learning as recollection; what it means to "know"

## The Synthesis

Praxis-AI is a **modern operationalization of classical practical philosophy**:

> **Socrates** asks the questions that expose what we don't know  
> **Plato** provides the stages we must ascend through to know truly  
> **Aristotle** names the practice itself and provides the framework for wise action  

### The Three Philosophers and the Three Layers

| Philosopher | Contribution | Praxis Layer |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Plato | Eternal principles (Forms) | **Opinions** — Timeless viewpoints that bias decisions |
| Socrates | Critical examination (Elenchus) | **Governance** — The mechanism by which conflicts are resolved |
| Aristotle | Practical action (Praxis/Phronesis) | **Execution** — The work itself, governed by formalization contracts |

### The Policy Engine as Phronesis

Aristotle's phronesis answers: *Given general principles, what should I do in this particular situation?*

Praxis's Policy Engine does the same:

```
Domain + Stage + Privacy + Environment → Behavior
```

This is phronesis formalized — practical wisdom rendered as a deterministic resolution function.

### Formalize as the Cave Exit

The **Formalize** stage is the structural hinge in Praxis, just as the ascent from the cave is the turning point in Plato's philosophy:

- **Before Formalize:** You work with shadows (raw ideas, possibilities)
- **At Formalize:** You commit to a reality (concrete plans, frozen decisions)
- **After Formalize:** You work in the light (execution of known scope)

Recognizing which mode you're in prevents:
- Wasted effort (polishing undefined things)
- Expensive rework (discovering scope mid-execution)

## Why This Matters for AI-Assisted Work

Classical philosophy grappled with the same core problem Praxis addresses:

> **How do we move from thinking to acting wisely?**

The ancients didn't have AI, but they had the same bottleneck: *intent-maintenance is harder than production*. A sophist could generate endless arguments; a craftsman could produce endless objects. But ensuring those arguments or objects served human flourishing required governance — phronesis, dialectic, examination.

AI amplifies the production side to unprecedented levels. The governance side remains human-limited. Praxis provides the leverage:

- Canonical decisions (no rediscovering rejected ideas)
- Explicit scope boundaries (no endless dialectic)
- Stage gates (forced examination at key moments)

This lets fixed human intent govern unbounded AI output — the same goal the Greeks had when distinguishing praxis from mere poiesis.
