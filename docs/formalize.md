# Praxis Formalize — Domain Definitions (v0.1)

## Purpose
Formalize is the structural hinge between ideation and execution.
Its role is to convert intent into a bounded, executable plan with explicit constraints,
so work can proceed without inventing requirements.

Formalize artifacts are **domain-specific**, but share a common spine:
- Intent
- Scope & boundaries
- Constraints
- Execution framing
- Commit criteria

Commit marks the transition from refinement to execution.

---

## Shared Formalize Spine (All Domains)

Each domain’s Formalize artifact MUST explicitly define:

### 1. Intent & Outcome
- Problem / Thesis / Creative Intent
- Audience or user
- Success criteria
- Why now

### 2. Scope & Boundaries
- In scope
- Out of scope (non-goals)
- Assumptions
- Dependencies

### 3. Constraints (Hard Guardrails)
- Domain constraints
- Environment overlay (work vs personal)
- Privacy classification
- Tooling limits
- Time / effort caps

### 4. Execution Framing
- First executable increment
- Risks & mitigations
- Open questions → explicit spikes

### 5. Commit Criteria
Formalize is complete only when:
- Success is unambiguous
- Scope is bounded
- Constraints are complete
- Unknowns are resolved or spiked
- Allowed execution artifacts are declared

## Domain: Build

### Formalize Artifact
**Solution Overview Document (SOD)**

### Role
The SOD is the Formalize contract for software, systems, and tools.
It locks intent, boundaries, and constraints while remaining implementation-light.

### Required Sections (SOD-lite)
- Problem Statement
- Business Context / Drivers
- Goals
- Non-Goals
- Functional Overview
- High-Level Architecture / Workflow
- Assumptions
- Constraints (Technical, Security, Compliance, Operational)
- Dependencies
- Phases / Increments
- Risks & Mitigations
- Open Questions (or Spikes)
- Glossary / Definitions
- Commit Readiness Checklist

### Explicit Exclusions
- Low-level design
- Task breakdowns
- Implementation detail
- Experiments not framed as spikes

---

## Domain: Create

### Formalize Artifact
**Creative Brief**

### Role
Convert inspiration into bounded creative intent without constraining exploration prematurely.

### Required Sections
- Creative Intent / Theme
- Audience / Context
- Desired Emotional or Aesthetic Outcome
- Style References / Influences
- Constraints (format, medium, tools, timebox)
- What This Is Not (anti-goals)
- Iteration Strategy
- Definition of “Done”
- Commit Criteria

### Explicit Exclusions
- Executable code
- Formal documentation
- Production pipelines

---

## Domain: Write

### Formalize Artifact
**Writing Brief**

### Role
Prevent meandering by fixing thesis, audience, and scope before drafting.

### Required Sections
- Thesis / Core Argument
- Intended Audience
- Tone & Voice
- Outline / Logical Structure
- Sources / Citation Policy
- Constraints (length, format, venue)
- Non-Goals
- Completion Criteria
- Commit Criteria

### Explicit Exclusions
- Line editing
- Polishing
- Final formatting

---

## Domain: Learn

### Formalize Artifact
**Learning Plan**

### Role
Turn curiosity into directed learning with clear payoff.

### Required Sections
- Learning Objective
- Motivation / Application
- Scope (what will be learned)
- Out of Scope
- Resources
- Constraints (time, depth)
- Evidence of Learning (what proves success)
- Commit Criteria

### Explicit Exclusions
- Open-ended wandering
- Resource hoarding without intent

---

## Domain: Project Planning

### Formalize Artifact
**Project Charter**

### Role
Align intent, stakeholders, and sequencing before execution begins.

### Required Sections
- Project Objective
- Stakeholders
- Success Metrics
- Scope / Non-Scope
- Constraints
- Risks
- Milestones / Increments
- Commit Criteria

### Explicit Exclusions
- Task-level planning
- Tool-specific workflows

---

## Notes
- Formalize artifacts are versioned.
- Domain and Environment overlays may modify constraints without redefining intent.
- Privacy classification may be upgraded mid-lifecycle and must trigger stricter rules.
- Commit is a deliberate act, not a feeling.
