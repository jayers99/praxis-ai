## Commitment Statement

I commit to this 4-week pytest learning plan. The scope is locked:
- Week 1: Basics
- Week 2: Fixtures
- Week 3: Parametrization
- Week 4: Mocking

Evidence of success: Test suite for personal project + teach colleague + apply at work.

Any scope changes (adding plugins, advanced topics) require regression to Formalize stage.
