## Changes from v1

### Gold color adjustment
- **Old:** #D4AF37 (bright, slightly yellow)
- **New:** #C9A961 (warmer, deeper, richer tone)
- **Result:** Feels more premium and vintage-authentic

### URL prominence increase
- **Old:** Futura Medium, 16pt
- **New:** Futura Bold, 22pt, with thin burgundy underline accent
- **Result:** URL is now clearly the primary CTA, visually distinct

### Corner flourishes refinement
- **Old:** 12pt stroke weight, geometric curves
- **New:** 6pt stroke weight, more organic curves, slightly smaller scale
- **Result:** Delicate and elegant, not overpowering the composition

## Additional refinements (designer-initiated)

- Increased letter-spacing on "New Year's Eve Celebration" by 5% (more elegant rhythm)
- Adjusted champagne glass illustration line weight for consistency (uniform 3pt strokes)
- Refined vintage texture overlay (reduced to 8% opacity, less visible grain)
- Instagram variant: Simplified corner flourishes further for mobile legibility
