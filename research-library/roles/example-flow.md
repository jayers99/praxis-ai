## Executive Summary

- Worked example showing how Praxis Roles flow through a CLI utility project
- Demonstrates role handoffs across lifecycle stages: Explore → Shape → Decide → Execute → Review
- Each role has specific responsibilities and outputs

## Consensus Rating

**Medium**: Illustrative example. Useful for understanding but not validated against real execution.

## Body

### Scenario

Design and implement a small CLI utility.

### Explore

- **Red Team** challenges assumptions

### Decide

- **Synthesis** resolves into one direction
