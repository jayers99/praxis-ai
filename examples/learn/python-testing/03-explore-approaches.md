# Explore — Learning Approaches

**Stage:** Explore

## Option 1: Book-First Approach

**Strategy:** Read "Python Testing with pytest" cover-to-cover, then apply

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive conceptual foundation
- Author's progression is well-designed

**Cons:**
- Front-loaded reading (may delay practice)
- Risk of passive learning (reading ≠ understanding)

---

## Option 2: Project-Based Approach

**Strategy:** Start writing tests for personal CLI tool, learn features as needed

**Pros:**
- Immediate application to real project
- Motivation stays high (tangible progress)

**Cons:**
- May miss important concepts (learn gaps, not foundations)
- Risk of building on weak understanding

---

## Option 3: Hybrid Structured + Hands-On ✓ SELECTED

**Strategy:** Weekly rhythm of structured learning + deliberate practice

**Weekly Pattern:**
1. **Read** (1 hour): Book chapter + docs on topic
2. **Practice** (2 hours): Isolated exercises for specific feature
3. **Apply** (1.5 hours): Use feature in personal project tests
4. **Reflect** (0.5 hours): What worked, what struggled with, what to revisit

**Progression:**
- Week 1: pytest basics (setup, assertions, test discovery)
- Week 2: Fixtures (scope, conftest.py, fixture composition)
- Week 3: Parametrization (test variations, data-driven tests)
- Week 4: Mocking (unittest.mock, monkeypatch, external dependencies)

**Pros:**
- Balances theory and practice
- Weekly rhythm builds momentum
- Reflection ensures retention
- Personal project provides realistic context

**Cons:**
- Requires discipline (structured schedule)

## Decision Rationale

Option 3 (Hybrid) selected because:
- Addresses learning style (hands-on > passive reading)
- 4-week timeline fits available time budget
- Weekly reflection reinforces retention
- Personal project makes learning concrete
