## Purpose

This document defines **execution-level guardrails** for Praxis.

Guardrails are:

- Context-specific
- Explicitly binding during execution
- Designed to reduce ambiguity and risk
- Expected to evolve over time

This file intentionally starts **empty**.

No guardrail should exist without:

- A clear link to principles
- Alignment with governance decisions
- Evidence from execution or learning

---

## Layer Declaration

**Layer:** Execution

This document is constrained by:

- [`decision-arbitration.md`](decision-arbitration.md) (governance)
- Informed by [`opinions/code/principles.md`](opinions/code/principles.md) (opinions)

If a conflict arises:

- Governance arbitrates
- Principles inform
- Execution complies

---

## Scope (To Be Defined)

This file may eventually include guardrails for:

- Coding practices
- Testing expectations
- Issue discipline
- Source control usage
- AI / Claude behavior during execution
- Security and safety constraints

None are defined yet.

---

## Activation Criteria

This document becomes **active** only when:

- Specific guardrails are added
- Each guardrail includes rationale and scope
- Guardrails are reviewed against principles
- Conflicts are resolvable via governance

---

## Change Policy

Guardrails may change frequently.

All changes should be:

- Intentional
- Documented
- Reversible where possible

---

## Status

This document is a **placeholder by design**.

Its emptiness is intentional and signals restraint.
