# Spike 01: Lifecycle Stage Research Report

**Spike:** Research Lifecycle Stage Definitions
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Time Budget:** 60 minutes
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This spike researched prior art, academic foundations, and industry best practices for each of the 9 Praxis lifecycle stages. Key findings confirm that Praxis stages align well with established methodologies (Design Thinking, Stage-Gate, ITIL, Agile) while offering unique value in the explicit "structural hinge" at Formalize.

**Overall Confidence:** High. All 9 stages have strong prior art support.

---

## Stage-by-Stage Research

### 1. Capture

**Praxis Definition:** Collect raw inputs with minimal friction. No commitment or structure required.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Design Thinking (d.school/IDEO) | "Empathize" / "Discover" | Gather user insights through observation and interviews |
| Double Diamond (UK Design Council) | "Discover" | Research broadly to understand the full problem space |
| Brainstorming (Osborn, 1953) | "Ideation" | Generate ideas without judgment; quantity over quality |
| GTD (David Allen) | "Capture" | Externalize thoughts to trusted system with zero friction |

**Key Influencers:**
- Alex Osborn (brainstorming methodology)
- David Allen (Getting Things Done)
- Tim Brown / IDEO (Design Thinking)
- UK Design Council (Double Diamond)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Capture" ≈ Design Thinking "Empathize" + "Discover"
- Praxis "Capture" ≈ GTD "Capture" / "Collect"
- Praxis "Capture" ≈ Double Diamond "Discover"

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Our Capture stage combines two distinct activities that some frameworks separate:
  1. **Observation/empathy** (understanding users/context)
  2. **Idea generation** (brain dumps, brainstorming)
- Consider whether sub-phases would add clarity or overhead

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Strong alignment with GTD's frictionless capture principle
- Design Thinking's "Empathize" validates user-centric input gathering

---

### 2. Sense

**Praxis Definition:** Convert raw inputs into understanding. Light organization, tagging, summarization, pattern recognition.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Karl Weick | "Sensemaking" | ESR model: Enactment-Selection-Retention |
| Design Thinking | "Define" | Synthesize insights into clear problem statements |
| Affinity Mapping | "Clustering" | Group related items to reveal patterns |
| Double Diamond | "Define" | Consolidate findings into focused problem definition |

**Key Influencers:**
- Karl Weick (Sensemaking in Organizations, 1995)
- Brenda Dervin (Sense-Making Methodology)
- d.school (Define phase)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Sense" ≈ Weick "Sensemaking"
- Praxis "Sense" ≈ Design Thinking "Define" (partially)
- Praxis "Sense" ≈ Affinity Mapping / Thematic Analysis

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Weick's ESR model (Enactment-Selection-Retention) could inform how we describe the Sense process
- The term "Sense" is less common than "Define" in industry—consider whether this is a feature (differentiation) or friction (learning curve)
- Design Thinking's "Define" stage often includes problem framing, which Praxis defers to Shape

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Weick's sensemaking theory directly supports this stage
- Clear distinction from Capture (raw input) and Explore (possibilities)

---

### 3. Explore

**Praxis Definition:** Generate possibilities without obligation. Ideation, divergence, speculative thinking. Abandonment is safe.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Design Thinking | "Ideate" | Brainstorm wide range of solutions; divergent thinking |
| Double Diamond | "Develop" | Generate and refine potential solutions |
| IDEO | "Ideation" | Quantity over quality; wild ideas welcome |
| Divergent Thinking (Guilford) | "Divergence" | Generate multiple solutions to open-ended problems |

**Key Influencers:**
- J.P. Guilford (divergent thinking, 1967)
- Tim Brown / IDEO (Design Thinking)
- d.school Stanford (Ideate phase)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Explore" ≈ Design Thinking "Ideate"
- Praxis "Explore" ≈ Guilford "Divergent Thinking"
- Praxis "Explore" ≈ Double Diamond "Develop" (first half)

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Design Thinking typically pairs Ideate with rapid prototyping—Praxis separates these more cleanly
- "Explore" as a term is broader than "Ideate" and may encompass research/discovery beyond pure ideation
- Strong emphasis on "abandonment is safe" is unique to Praxis—not typically explicit in other frameworks

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Direct mapping to well-established divergent thinking literature
- Clear purpose and boundaries

---

### 4. Shape

**Praxis Definition:** Converge toward a viable direction. Selection, refinement, simplification, preliminary structuring. Work remains reversible.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Convergent Thinking | "Convergence" | Narrow options using criteria and constraints |
| Double Diamond | "Develop" (second half) | Refine ideas based on feasibility |
| Basecamp (Shape Up) | "Shaping" | Define scope, appetite, and solution boundaries |
| Decision Matrix | "Option Selection" | Score options against weighted criteria |

**Key Influencers:**
- J.P. Guilford (convergent thinking)
- Ryan Singer / Basecamp (Shape Up methodology)
- UK Design Council (Double Diamond convergence)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Shape" ≈ Convergent Thinking
- Praxis "Shape" ≈ Shape Up "Shaping"
- Praxis "Shape" ≈ Double Diamond second convergence

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Basecamp's "Shape Up" methodology uses "Shaping" very similarly—worth deeper investigation
- The emphasis on "work remains reversible" distinguishes Shape from Formalize nicely
- Design constraints as "creative lenses" (from research) aligns with our approach

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Strong alignment with Shape Up methodology
- Clear role as the "narrowing" counterpart to Explore

---

### 5. Formalize (Structural Hinge)

**Praxis Definition:** Convert shaped thinking into durable, policy-bearing artifacts. Establishes intent, scope, constraints, success criteria. Primary output: SOD.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Agile | "Definition of Done" / "Acceptance Criteria" | Explicit conditions for completion |
| Waterfall | "Requirements Specification" | Detailed upfront documentation |
| Stage-Gate | "Business Case" | Formal justification at gate review |
| Contract Law | "Formalization" | Reducing agreements to enforceable form |

**Key Influencers:**
- PMI (Project Management Institute)
- Robert G. Cooper (Stage-Gate)
- Agile Alliance (Definition of Done)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Formalize" ≈ "Requirements Specification" (Waterfall)
- Praxis "Formalize" ≈ "Business Case" (Stage-Gate)
- Praxis "Formalize" ≈ "Contract" / "Spec" (general)
- SOD ≈ "Definition of Done" + "Acceptance Criteria" + "Scope Document"

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Praxis's explicit "structural hinge" concept is UNIQUE—most frameworks treat formalization as just another phase
- The distinction between "discovery iteration" (pre-Formalize) and "refinement iteration" (post-Formalize) is powerful and not commonly articulated
- Waterfall over-formalizes; Agile under-formalizes—Praxis seeks a balance
- The SOD concept deserves its own spike to compare with PRDs, BRDs, and other artifacts

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Strong theoretical foundation in the discovery/refinement distinction
- Risk: may need to clarify how "light" a formalization can be for small work

---

### 6. Commit

**Praxis Definition:** Explicitly decide to proceed. Locks scope and intent, allocates effort, enforces policy invariants.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Stage-Gate (Cooper) | "Gate Decision" | Go/Kill/Hold/Recycle decision points |
| Psychology | "Commitment" | Public declaration increases follow-through |
| Agile | "Sprint Commitment" | Team commits to sprint backlog |
| PMI | "Project Charter Approval" | Formal authorization to proceed |

**Key Influencers:**
- Robert G. Cooper (Stage-Gate inventor)
- Robert Cialdini (commitment psychology)
- Scrum Alliance (sprint commitment)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Commit" ≈ Stage-Gate "Go Decision"
- Praxis "Commit" ≈ Agile "Sprint Planning Commitment"
- Praxis "Commit" ≈ PMI "Authorization"

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Stage-Gate research shows "gates without teeth" are common failures—our Commit stage needs explicit decision criteria
- Psychology research confirms public commitment increases follow-through
- The separation of Commit from Formalize is valuable—formalization without commitment is still exploratory
- McKinsey's "Decision Gates" (vs. "Stage Gates") distinction is worth examining

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Clear prior art in Stage-Gate methodology
- Psychological foundations support the concept

---

### 7. Execute

**Praxis Definition:** Produce the artifact. Coding, writing, illustration, or other implementation. AI behavior is tightly governed.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| SDLC | "Implementation" / "Development" | Build the software |
| Agile | "Sprint Execution" | Work on committed backlog items |
| Design Thinking | "Prototype" | Build to learn and test |
| Double Diamond | "Deliver" | Finalize and implement |

**Key Influencers:**
- Kent Beck (Extreme Programming)
- Scrum (Sprint execution)
- SAFe (Program Increment execution)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Execute" ≈ SDLC "Implementation"
- Praxis "Execute" ≈ Agile "Sprint Execution"
- Praxis "Execute" ≈ Double Diamond "Deliver"

**Gaps/Observations:**
- Praxis explicitly governs AI behavior during Execute—this is novel and important
- The distinction between Execute and Sustain is clearer in Praxis than in many frameworks
- Design Thinking's "Prototype" + "Test" phases map roughly to Execute + early Sustain

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Well-established concept across all methodologies
- Clear boundaries with Commit (before) and Sustain (after)

---

### 8. Sustain

**Praxis Definition:** Maintain and govern delivered work. Updates, evaluation, optimization, policy enforcement over time.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| ITIL | "Service Operation" + "CSI" | Day-to-day delivery + continuous improvement |
| DevOps | "Operate" / "Monitor" | Maintain reliability, high availability |
| SDLC | "Maintenance" | Bug fixes, updates, support |
| Product Management | "Growth" / "Maturity" | Ongoing product evolution |

**Key Influencers:**
- ITIL Foundation (Service Lifecycle)
- DevOps movement (continuous operations)
- Gene Kim / Phoenix Project (DevOps culture)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Sustain" ≈ ITIL "Service Operation"
- Praxis "Sustain" ≈ DevOps "Operate" + "Monitor"
- Praxis "Sustain" ≈ SDLC "Maintenance"

**Gaps/Observations:**
- ITIL's "Continual Service Improvement" (CSI) maps well to Praxis's view of Sustain
- The distinction between "bug fix" (stays in Sustain) and "scope expansion" (regresses to Commit) is valuable
- DevOps "infinity loop" metaphor aligns with our cyclical lifecycle view
- ITIL 4's shift from "lifecycle" to "Service Value System" is worth monitoring

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Strong alignment with ITIL and DevOps practices
- Clear regression triggers defined

---

### 9. Close

**Praxis Definition:** End work intentionally and capture leverage. Archiving, capturing learnings, retiring work, seeding future cycles.

**Prior Art:**

| Source | Term Used | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| PMI | "Project Closure" | Formal sign-off, lessons learned, archiving |
| Agile | "Retrospective" | Reflect on process improvements |
| Knowledge Management | "Lessons Learned" | Capture and transfer knowledge |
| ITIL | "Service Retirement" | Decommission services intentionally |

**Key Influencers:**
- PMI (PMBOK Project Closing Process Group)
- Agile Alliance (Retrospectives)
- Esther Derby & Diana Larsen (Agile Retrospectives)

**Terminology Mapping:**
- Praxis "Close" ≈ PMI "Project Closing"
- Praxis "Close" ≈ Agile "Retrospective" (partially)
- Praxis "Close" ≈ ITIL "Service Retirement"

**Gaps/Observations:**
- "Seeding future cycles" is explicit in Praxis but often implicit elsewhere
- Close → Capture regression path is unique and valuable
- PMI research shows 27% higher success rate when lessons learned are captured
- Many organizations skip formal closure—Praxis makes it explicit

**Confidence in Definition:** HIGH
- Strong PMI and Agile foundations
- The "seeding future cycles" concept connects Close back to Capture elegantly

## Cross-Cutting Findings

### 1. The Double Diamond Alignment

The UK Design Council's Double Diamond maps well to Praxis:

| Double Diamond | Praxis Stages |
|----------------|---------------|
| Discover | Capture |
| Define | Sense + Shape |
| Develop | Explore + Shape |
| Deliver | Execute |

**Gap:** Double Diamond doesn't have explicit equivalents for Formalize, Commit, Sustain, or Close. This is Praxis's value add.

### 2. The Stage-Gate Alignment

Cooper's Stage-Gate process shares DNA with Praxis:

| Stage-Gate | Praxis |
|------------|--------|
| Scoping | Capture + Sense |
| Business Case | Formalize |
| Gate Decision | Commit |
| Development | Execute |
| Testing | Execute + Sustain |
| Launch | Sustain |
| Post-Launch Review | Close |

**Insight:** Stage-Gate's "gates" are Praxis's Commit points. The key difference is Praxis allows regression; Stage-Gate traditionally does not.

### 3. The ITIL Alignment

ITIL's Service Lifecycle maps to post-Formalize Praxis:

| ITIL | Praxis |
|------|--------|
| Service Strategy | Shape + Formalize |
| Service Design | Formalize |
| Service Transition | Commit + Execute |
| Service Operation | Sustain |
| CSI | Sustain + Close |
| Retirement | Close |

### 4. Unique Praxis Contributions

What Praxis offers that others don't:

1. **Explicit Formalize hinge** — Most frameworks blur exploration and execution
2. **Allowed regression model** — Stage-Gate says "kill or continue"; Praxis says "regress and fix"
3. **Close → Capture loop** — Explicit knowledge transfer to future cycles
4. **AI governance by stage** — Novel; no prior art found
