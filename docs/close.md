# Close (Code / CLI)

**Stage:** Close

---

## Closure decision

**Decision:** [ ] Deprecate / [ ] Archive / [ ] Replace

**Rationale:**

## Migration path (if replaced)

<!-- Where should users go? What replaces this? -->

- Replacement tool:
- Migration guide location:
- Deadline for migration:

## Deprecation notice

<!-- How users are notified -->

- [ ] Deprecation warning in `--version` output
- [ ] README updated with notice
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry added

## Leverage capture

<!-- What did we learn? What can be reused? -->

### Patterns worth keeping

### Lessons learned

### Code to preserve
