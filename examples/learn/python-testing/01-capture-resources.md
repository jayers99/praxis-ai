## Resources Collected

### Primary Resources
- **pytest official docs:** https://docs.pytest.org/
- **Book:** "Python Testing with pytest" by Brian Okken (2nd edition)
- **Tutorial:** Real Python's pytest guide

### Code Examples
- Team's existing test suite (work repository)
- pytest-dev GitHub repo (official examples)
- Personal project that needs tests (CLI tool for task management)

### Colleague Recommendations
- Focus on fixtures (most powerful feature, biggest learning curve)
- Learn parametrization early (makes tests DRY)
- Understand conftest.py for shared fixtures
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, database, filesystem)

---

## Motivation

**Why learn pytest:**
- Team is standardizing on pytest (moving away from unittest)
- Upcoming project requires comprehensive test coverage
- Current knowledge gap: Can write basic asserts, struggle with fixtures and mocking

**Why now:**
- Project starts in 5 weeks (need working knowledge before then)
- Colleague offered to review progress weekly (accountability)

**Next:** Identify specific knowledge gaps (Sense stage)
