# Writing Brief

**Domain:** Write

<!-- This template implements the Formalize Spine from lifecycle.md.
     All five sections are required before proceeding to Commit. -->

---

## 1. Intent & Outcome

<!-- What thesis or message are we communicating? Why now? Who reads it?
     Good example: "Article arguing that remote-first teams outperform
     hybrid setups. Target: engineering managers evaluating team structure.
     Timely: Q1 planning season when reorg decisions are made." -->

### Thesis

<!-- One-paragraph statement of the core argument or message -->

### Project Context

- Title:
- Client/Stakeholder:
- Occasion/Context:

### Audience

<!-- Who reads this? What do they already know? What do they need? -->

### Why Now

<!-- What makes this timely? Publication cycle, event, decision window? -->

---

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

<!-- What's in, what's out, what are we assuming?
     Good example: In: Main argument + 3 supporting case studies.
     Out: Historical survey, competing frameworks. Assumption: Reader
     has basic familiarity with remote work terminology. -->

### In Scope

-

### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

-

### Assumptions

<!-- What are we taking for granted about the reader or context? -->

-

### Dependencies

<!-- Sources, interviews, or research this work depends on -->

-

---

## 3. Constraints

<!-- Boundaries that shape the writing.
     Good example: Voice: authoritative but accessible. Length: 1500-2000 words.
     Must cite at least 3 peer-reviewed sources. Platform: company blog. -->

### Voice & Tone

<!-- Style, register, formality level -->

-

### Length & Format

<!-- Word count, structure, platform requirements -->

-

### Source Requirements

<!-- Citation standards, required references, fact-checking needs -->

-

### Technical Constraints

<!-- Platform, CMS, formatting requirements -->

-

### Time/Effort Cap

<!-- Maximum investment before re-evaluation -->

-

---

## 4. Execution Framing

<!-- How do we start? What could go wrong? What don't we know yet?
     Good example: First draft: outline + intro paragraph for tone check.
     Risk: Sources may not support thesis. Open question: Interview subject? -->

### First Draft Milestone

<!-- Smallest writing artifact that validates direction -->

-

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
|      |            |        |            |

### Open Questions

<!-- Research or structural unknowns that must be resolved -->

-

---

## 5. Commit Criteria

- Working headline:
- Key points:
- Required details:

### Deliverables

- Primary deliverable(s) (e.g., article, doc, memo):
