## Four-Lens Analysis

### First Principles Lens

**Focus:** Fundamental truths that must hold regardless of implementation

**Questions for this lens:**
- What is the core problem being solved?
- What constraints are truly immutable vs. assumed?
- What would a solution look like from first principles?

**Assigned questions from research:**
1.
2.

**Search guidance:**
- Academic papers, foundational texts
- Mathematical or logical proofs
- Core definitions and axioms

---

### Best Practices Lens

**Focus:** Industry patterns, standards, and proven approaches

**Questions for this lens:**
- What do established frameworks recommend?
- What patterns have widespread adoption?
- What standards govern this space?

**Assigned questions from research:**
1.
2.

**Search guidance:**
- Official documentation
- Industry standards (ISO, RFC, etc.)
- Well-maintained open source implementations
- Enterprise architecture patterns

---

### Guru Wisdom Lens

**Focus:** Expert heuristics, intuition, and experience-based guidance

**Questions for this lens:**
- What do thought leaders say?
- What's the "tribal knowledge" in this space?
- What non-obvious insights exist?

**Assigned questions from research:**
1.
2.

**Search guidance:**
- Conference talks (Strange Loop, QCon, etc.)
- Expert blogs (Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, etc.)
- Books by practitioners
- Podcast interviews

---

### Anti-Patterns Lens

**Focus:** Documented failures, pitfalls, and what to avoid

**Questions for this lens:**
- What approaches have failed?
- What are the common mistakes?
- What does "bad" look like?

**Assigned questions from research:**
1.
2.

**Search guidance:**

## Synthesis Approach

<!-- How will findings from different lenses be combined? -->

**Expected tensions:**
- First Principles vs. Best Practices:
- Guru Wisdom vs. Anti-Patterns:

**Resolution strategy:**
<!-- How will conflicts be adjudicated? -->
