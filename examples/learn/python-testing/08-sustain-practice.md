# Sustain — Ongoing Practice & Application

**Stage:** Sustain  
**Date:** 2025-12-01 onwards

---

## Evidence of Learning (Week 4 Completion)

### 1. Test Suite Complete ✓
- Personal CLI project: 57 tests written
- Coverage: 84% (exceeds 80% target)
- Uses fixtures (12), parametrization (8 tests), mocking (6 tests)

### 2. Teach Demonstration ✓
- Taught colleague fixtures on Nov 30 (30-minute session)
- Covered: fixture scopes, conftest.py, fixture composition
- Colleague feedback: "Clear explanations, good examples, I'm using fixtures now"

### 3. Work Application ✓
- Refactored team test from unittest setup/teardown to pytest fixtures
- Code review approved (Dec 1)
- Team lead: "This is much cleaner than the old pattern"

### 4. Documentation Independence ✓
- Can write fixtures and parametrized tests without docs lookup
- Mocking still requires occasional reference (acceptable for advanced topic)

## Post-Learning Activities (Week 5+)

### Week 5 (Dec 2-8)
- Applied pytest to team project (3 new test files)
- Caught bug during test writing (validation edge case)
- Team member asked about fixtures (taught informally)

### Week 6 (Dec 9-15)
- Created conftest.py for team project (shared fixtures)
- Added parametrized tests for input validation
- Team code review: "Nice use of pytest features"

### Week 7 (Dec 16-22)
- Wrote tests for new feature (20 tests, 90% coverage)
- Used mocking for external API calls (confident now)
- Helped junior developer debug failing test

---

## Retention Practice (Weekly)

**Friday pytest review (15 minutes):**
- Review 1 pytest feature per week (rotate through fixtures, parametrization, mocking)
- Read team tests (learn from others' patterns)
- Update personal project tests (add coverage for new features)

---

## Advanced Topics (Future Learning)

Identified for future exploration (not in original scope):
- **Hypothesis** (property-based testing) — for complex input validation
- **pytest-mock** plugin — cleaner mocking syntax
- **pytest plugins** — custom markers, hooks, plugin development

---

## Sustain vs. New Iteration — Decision Log

### What Stayed in Sustain (Skill Maintenance)
✓ Weekly pytest review practice  
✓ Applying pytest to team work  
✓ Teaching others (reinforces understanding)  
✓ Updating personal project tests

### What Would Trigger New Learning Project
✗ Property-based testing (Hypothesis) — new domain, separate plan  
✗ pytest plugin development — significant scope expansion  
✗ Advanced mocking patterns — beyond basics, new competency target

---

## Long-Term Skill Maintenance

**Evidence of sustained learning:**
- Month 2: Wrote 100+ tests across 3 team projects
- Month 3: Became go-to person for pytest questions on team
- Month 6: Proposed pytest workshop for new hires

**Current proficiency:** Can write comprehensive test suites confidently, troubleshoot test failures efficiently, teach pytest basics to others.

## Close Criteria (when to archive this learning project)

This project will remain in Sustain until:
1. pytest skills are fully internalized (no active practice needed)
2. New learning project supersedes this one (e.g., advanced testing topics)
3. Team adopts different testing framework (unlikely)

**Current status:** Active sustain, weekly practice continues, skills applied regularly.

---

**Next:** Continue sustain indefinitely, or close when pytest mastery is fully internalized
