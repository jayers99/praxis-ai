# Spike 01: Lifecycle Stage Research

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Time Budget:** 60 minutes
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This spike researched prior art, key influencers, and entry/exit criteria patterns for all nine Praxis lifecycle stages. The research validates that Praxis stages align well with established methodologies while offering a unique synthesis that bridges creative, technical, and organizational workflows.

**Key Finding:** The Praxis lifecycle synthesizes concepts from GTD (Capture), Zettelkasten (fleeting notes), Design Thinking (Empathize/Define), Cynefin Framework (Sense), Double Diamond (diverge/converge), Shape Up (Shaping/Betting), Software Engineering (SRS/Stage-Gate), ITIL (Service Operation), and Project Management (Closure/Post-mortem).

## Stage-by-Stage Research

### 1. Capture

**Praxis Definition:** Collect raw inputs with minimal friction. Includes notes, images, references, ideas, and observations. No commitment or structure is required.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| GTD (David Allen) | Capture / Inbox | GTD focuses on actionable items; Praxis includes all inputs |
| Zettelkasten (Luhmann) | Fleeting Notes | Zettelkasten assumes future refinement; Praxis allows permanent capture-only |
| Design Thinking (IDEO) | Empathize / Observe | Design Thinking is user-focused; Praxis is broader |

#### Key Influencers

- **David Allen** — GTD's "ubiquitous capture" and "mind like water" concepts
- **Niklas Luhmann** — Zettelkasten fleeting notes (90,000 notes over 40 years)
- **Jane Fulton Suri (IDEO)** — "Thoughtless Acts" observation methodology

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| GTD | Any thought crosses mind | Item is in a trusted inbox |
| Zettelkasten | Idea emerges | Fleeting note recorded |
| Praxis | Any input exists | Input is stored in a retrievable location |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** The Praxis Capture stage aligns strongly with GTD's capture and Zettelkasten's fleeting notes. The key distinction (no commitment required) is well-supported by the literature.

**Potential Enhancement:** Consider explicit guidance on "over-capturing" — GTD warns that not everything deserves capture.

---

### 2. Sense

**Praxis Definition:** Convert raw inputs into understanding. Includes light organization, tagging, summarization, and pattern recognition. Outputs remain environment-neutral and low-commitment.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Cynefin (Snowden) | Sense-making | Cynefin is decision-context focused; Praxis is input-processing focused |
| Zettelkasten | Literature Notes | Zettelkasten assumes source material; Praxis includes raw observations |
| Weick | Organizational Sensemaking | Weick is retrospective/social; Praxis can be individual/forward-looking |

#### Key Influencers

- **Karl Weick** — Organizational sensemaking theory (7 properties)
- **Dave Snowden** — Cynefin "probe-sense-respond" for complex domains
- **Niklas Luhmann** — Literature notes as interpretation layer

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Cynefin | Situation is ambiguous | Domain is identified (clear/complicated/complex/chaotic) |
| Weick | Event has occurred | Plausible interpretation exists |
| Praxis | Captured inputs exist | Inputs have meaning/context attached |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**Medium-High.** The Sense stage is less common as an explicit stage in other frameworks. Praxis adds value by making this implicit step explicit. Weick's sensemaking theory provides strong theoretical grounding.

**Key Insight from Weick:** "Driven by plausibility over accuracy" — Sense doesn't require truth, just workable understanding.

---

### 3. Explore

**Praxis Definition:** Generate possibilities without obligation. Supports ideation, divergence, and speculative thinking. Abandonment is expected and safe.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Double Diamond | Discover (divergent) | Double Diamond combines discover + define; Praxis separates them |
| Design Thinking | Ideate | Design Thinking ideation comes after problem definition |
| Cynefin | Probe (complex domain) | Cynefin's probe is for testing; Praxis explore is for generating |

#### Key Influencers

- **British Design Council** — Double Diamond (2005), divergent/convergent thinking
- **Alex Osborn & Sid Parnes** — Creative Problem Solving, divergent thinking origins
- **IDEO** — Brainstorming and ideation practices

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Double Diamond | Research complete | Options are visible |
| Design Thinking | Problem defined | Multiple solution concepts exist |
| Praxis | Sense is complete | Possibilities have been generated |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** Divergent exploration is well-established in design and creativity literature. The explicit permission for abandonment is a valuable addition not always stated elsewhere.

**Key Insight from Double Diamond:** "Exploring an issue more widely or deeply (divergent thinking)" — the goal is breadth, not commitment.

---

### 4. Shape

**Praxis Definition:** Converge toward a viable direction. Includes selection, refinement, simplification, and preliminary structuring. Work remains reversible.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Shape Up (Basecamp) | Shaping | Shape Up shaping includes appetite; Praxis Shape is pre-commitment |
| Double Diamond | Define (convergent) | Double Diamond is problem-focused; Praxis can be solution-focused |
| Design Thinking | Define | Design Thinking define creates problem statement; Praxis shapes direction |

#### Key Influencers

- **Ryan Singer (Basecamp)** — Shape Up methodology, shaping as design activity
- **British Design Council** — Convergent phase of Double Diamond
- **IDEO** — From ideation to concept selection

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Shape Up | Raw idea exists | Pitch is ready for betting table |
| Double Diamond | Options explored | Problem/opportunity is defined |
| Praxis | Possibilities explored | Viable direction is selected |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** Shape Up provides particularly strong prior art. The distinction between Shape (reversible) and Formalize (durable) is well-aligned with Shape Up's separation of shaping from betting.

**Key Insight from Shape Up:** "Fixed time, variable scope" — shaping defines what fits in the appetite, not what's ideal.

---

### 5. Formalize (Structural Hinge)

**Praxis Definition:** Convert shaped thinking into durable, policy-bearing artifacts. Establishes explicit intent, scope, constraints, and success criteria. Primary output: SOD.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Software Engineering | Software Requirements Specification (SRS) | SRS is requirements-focused; Praxis SOD is intent-focused |
| Shape Up | Pitch | Pitch is for betting decision; SOD is for execution governance |
| Stage-Gate | Gate documentation | Stage-Gate is approval-focused; Praxis is commitment-focused |

#### Key Influencers

- **IEEE** — Software Requirements Specification standard (1983)
- **Ryan Singer** — Pitch format in Shape Up
- **Robert G. Cooper** — Stage-Gate methodology

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| SRS | Requirements gathered | Document reviewed and approved |
| Stage-Gate | Previous phase complete | Gate criteria met |
| Praxis | Shape complete | SOD exists with scope, constraints, success criteria |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** The Formalize stage as a "structural hinge" is a novel and valuable contribution. It synthesizes SRS formality with Shape Up's appetite-bounded thinking.

**Key Insight:** "The objective of the requirements specification phase is to produce a clear, complete, unambiguous, non-contradictory description" — this is exactly what Praxis SOD aims to achieve.

---

### 6. Commit

**Praxis Definition:** Explicitly decide to proceed. Locks scope and intent, allocates effort, and enforces policy invariants. Only a small subset of formalized work should reach this stage.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Stage-Gate | Gate / Go-Kill Decision | Stage-Gate gates can be conditional; Praxis Commit is binary |
| Shape Up | Betting Table | Betting is time-boxed; Praxis Commit is scope-locked |
| Agile | Sprint Commitment | Sprint commitment is team-level; Praxis Commit is work-item level |

#### Key Influencers

- **Robert G. Cooper** — Stage-Gate go/kill decisions
- **Ryan Singer** — Betting Table concept
- **McKinsey** — "Decision gates with real teeth"

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Stage-Gate | Deliverables complete | Go/kill/conditional decision made |
| Shape Up | Pitch exists | Bet placed for next cycle |
| Praxis | SOD complete | Explicit commitment to proceed |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** The Commit stage is well-supported by Stage-Gate and Shape Up methodologies. The emphasis on "small subset" reaching Commit aligns with Shape Up's selective betting.

**Key Insight from Stage-Gate:** "Gates are not 'backward-looking', status reviews... they are 'forward-looking', where resource commitments are made!"

---

### 7. Execute

**Praxis Definition:** Produce the artifact. Includes coding, writing, illustration, or other implementation activities. AI behavior is tightly governed and driven by formalized intent.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Agile/Scrum | Sprint Execution | Sprint is time-boxed with ceremonies; Praxis Execute is outcome-focused |
| Waterfall | Implementation Phase | Waterfall is sequential; Praxis allows iteration within Execute |
| Shape Up | Build Cycle | Build cycle is 6-week fixed; Praxis Execute duration varies |

#### Key Influencers

- **Jeff Sutherland & Ken Schwaber** — Scrum framework
- **Agile Manifesto authors** — Iterative development principles
- **Ryan Singer** — Build cycle in Shape Up

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Scrum | Sprint planned | Increment is done (meets Definition of Done) |
| Shape Up | Bet placed | Hill chart shows work complete |
| Praxis | Commit complete | Artifact produced per SOD |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** Execute is the most universally understood stage. The Praxis innovation is tight governance by formalized intent, preventing scope creep.

**Key Insight from Agile:** "Sprints incorporate frequent testing, immediate feedback, daily meetings, continuous rectification of issues" — but Praxis Execute adds the constraint of SOD-bound scope.

---

### 8. Sustain

**Praxis Definition:** Maintain and govern delivered work. Includes updates, evaluation, optimization, and policy enforcement over time.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| ITIL | Service Operation | ITIL is IT-focused; Praxis Sustain is domain-agnostic |
| DevOps | Operate / Monitor | DevOps is technical; Praxis includes creative and written work |
| ITIL | Continual Service Improvement (CSI) | CSI is improvement-focused; Praxis Sustain includes maintenance |

#### Key Influencers

- **ITIL authors** — Service Operation and CSI stages
- **Gene Kim et al.** — DevOps principles (The Phoenix Project)
- **ISO/IEC 20000** — IT service management standard

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| ITIL | Service in production | Service retired or transitioned |
| DevOps | Deployment complete | System stable and monitored |
| Praxis | Execute complete | Work is maintained per policy |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**Medium-High.** ITIL provides strong prior art for technical work. Less explicit prior art exists for creative/written work sustenance. This is an area for potential enhancement.

**Key Insight from ITIL:** "Continual Service Improvement" — Sustain isn't static; it includes ongoing optimization.

---

### 9. Close

**Praxis Definition:** End work intentionally and capture leverage. Includes archiving artifacts, capturing learnings, retiring work, and seeding future cycles.

#### Prior Art

| Framework | Equivalent Concept | Key Difference |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Project Management | Project Closure | PM closure is administrative; Praxis Close captures leverage |
| Agile | Sprint Retrospective | Retrospective is per-sprint; Praxis Close is per-lifecycle |
| Post-mortem | Lessons Learned | Post-mortem is failure-focused; Praxis Close includes success capture |

#### Key Influencers

- **PMI** — Project closure processes
- **Wharton/Cornell/Colorado research** — Post-mortem value (33% improvement in outcome prediction)
- **Military** — After-Action Review (AAR) methodology

#### Entry/Exit Criteria Patterns

| Pattern | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| PMI | Project complete or cancelled | Sign-off, archive, lessons documented |
| Agile | Sprint ends | Retrospective complete |
| Praxis | Sustain complete or decision to end | Leverage captured, next cycle seeded |

#### Confidence in Current Definition

**High.** Project closure is well-established. The Praxis innovation is "seeding future cycles" — Close explicitly feeds Capture.

**Key Insight from Research:** "Spending time to take stock before, throughout, and at the end of a project can pay big dividends by increasing the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by almost one-third."

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### 1. The Formalize Hinge is Unique

No single framework places as much emphasis on the exploration-execution boundary as Praxis. Stage-Gate has gates, but they're approval points, not structural hinges. Shape Up has betting, but it's about resource allocation, not artifact formalization.

**Recommendation:** The SOD concept deserves deeper research and potential standardization.

### 2. Two Modes of Iteration Align with Literature

The distinction between "discovery iteration" (pre-Formalize) and "refinement iteration" (post-Formalize) aligns with:
- Double Diamond's diverge/converge pattern
- Shape Up's shaping vs. building separation
- Cynefin's distinction between complex (probe-sense-respond) and complicated (sense-analyze-respond)

### 3. Regression Model is Novel

The explicit regression table (which stages can regress to which) appears to be unique to Praxis. Most frameworks either don't address regression or treat it as failure.

**Recommendation:** Document the regression model as a key differentiator.

## Follow-Up Spikes Needed

### Spike 02: SOD Template Research
**Priority:** High
**Questions:**
- What makes a good Solution Overview Document?
- How does it differ from SRS, PRD, RFC, Design Doc?
- What's the minimum viable SOD?

### Spike 03: Sustain Stage for Non-Code Domains
**Priority:** Medium
**Questions:**
- What does "sustain" mean for creative work (Create domain)?
- What does "sustain" mean for written work (Write domain)?
- What does "sustain" mean for learning (Learn domain)?

### Spike 04: Regression Trigger Detection
**Priority:** Medium
**Questions:**
- Can regressions be detected automatically?
- What signals indicate premature stage advancement?
- How do other frameworks handle "going back"?

### Spike 05: Close-to-Capture Bridge
**Priority:** Low
**Questions:**
- How does Close explicitly seed Capture?
- What artifacts transfer?
- What's the handoff format?
