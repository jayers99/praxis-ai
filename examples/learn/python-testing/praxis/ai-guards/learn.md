# Learn Domain Guards — Python Testing

## Learning Goals

Focus on practical application:
- Write actual tests, not just read about testing
- Debug failing tests to understand edge cases
- Iterate on test quality

## Testing Principles

Follow pytest best practices:
- Use descriptive test names
- One assertion per test (when possible)
- Use fixtures for setup/teardown
- Group related tests in classes

## Code Quality

Practice test-driven development:
- Write failing test first
- Implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor while keeping tests green

## Resources

Reference official documentation:
- pytest docs for API questions
- Python docs for standard library
- Examples from existing test files
