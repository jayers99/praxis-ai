# Opinion: Creative Materials

> Physical and digital medium considerations

## Design Constraints

- Choose materials that support the intended outcome
- Understand material limitations before committing
- Consider durability, cost, and availability
- Match material quality to project importance

## Requirements

- Test materials before final production
- Document material specifications for reproducibility
- Plan for material sourcing and lead times
- Consider environmental and disposal implications

## Anti-Patterns

- Choosing materials based on cost alone
- Ignoring material behavior under real conditions
- Over-engineering for simple projects
- Under-specifying for important deliverables

## Assumed Context

- Physical or tangible output
- Material choice affects final quality
- May need to reproduce or maintain over time

## Summary

Select materials intentionally based on purpose, durability, and practical constraints.
