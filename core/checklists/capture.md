# Capture Stage Checklist

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Any input exists (idea, note, observation, reference)

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Input stored in retrievable location
- [ ] Content is accessible for future reference
- [ ] Minimal metadata added (date, source, context)

## Guidance

Capture is the entry point to the Praxis lifecycle. The goal is **maximum friction reduction**—get inputs into the system quickly without commitment or structure.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Collect raw inputs with minimal friction
- Store in a retrievable location
- No organization or processing required yet

**What Capture Is:**
- Notes, images, references, ideas, observations
- Quick captures without judgment
- Unstructured, unprocessed inputs

**What Capture Is Not:**
- Organized or categorized content
- Analyzed or synthesized information
- Commitment to action

**Tools & Practices:**
- Quick capture tools (notebooks, voice memos, screenshots)
- Inbox systems (GTD-style)
- Zettelkasten-style note-taking
- Bookmark managers
- Project-specific `docs/capture.md` file

## Progression

Once inputs are stored and retrievable, advance to **Sense** to add meaning and context.
