# Close — Transition Decision

**Stage:** Close  
**Date:** 2025-10-16

---

## Close Rationale

This Observe project has served its purpose. Over 2 weeks (Oct 1-15), captured 6 raw inputs on AI governance patterns. Through Sense and Explore stages, clear themes and connections emerged. In Shape stage, a coherent framework crystallized.

**What changed:** Intent shifted from "capture for later" to "synthesize and communicate"

---

## Transition Trigger

**From Observe domain specification:**

> "Observe is for raw capture and does not cross into execution. When synthesis, structure, or external communication emerges as intent, transition to appropriate domain."

**Trigger detected:** A clear argument is forming:

**Thesis:** "Organizations need layered AI governance (technical controls + organizational processes + policy frameworks) that compose into coherent architecture."

**Intent:** Communicate this framework through written synthesis

**Appropriate domain:** **Write** (structured externalized thought)

## What This Observe Project Delivered

### Artifacts Created
- 6 raw captures (HN, paper, podcast, Twitter, book, meeting)
- Sense artifact (3 themes identified)
- Explore artifact (5 key connections)
- Shape artifact (3 clusters, framework emerging)

### Value Delivered
- Identified recurring patterns across diverse sources
- Connected disparate ideas into coherent framework
- Validated framework against real-world context (work meeting)
- Created source material for future Write project

### What Observe Did NOT Do (By Design)
- ✗ Did not synthesize into polished argument
- ✗ Did not create Writing Brief (no formalize artifact)
- ✗ Did not draft article or documentation
- ✗ Did not execute any communication

**This is correct:** Observe is pre-formalization. Synthesis happens in Write domain.

## Domain Transition: Observe → Write

**New project decision:**
- **Domain:** Write
- **Project name:** "AI Governance Synthesis Article"
- **Thesis:** Layered governance framework for AI in production
- **Audience:** Engineering managers, technical leads
- **Source material:** All captures and artifacts from this Observe project

**Formalize artifact required:** `docs/brief.md` (Writing Brief)

**Key difference:**
- **Observe project:** Raw capture → themes → connections (no intent to execute)
- **Write project:** Formalize intent → draft → revise → publish (structured execution)

---

## Transition Process

### Step 1: Close Observe Project ✓
- Archive captures (reference for Write project)
- Mark project as "close" in praxis.yaml
- Capture learnings (what worked, what didn't)

### Step 2: Create Write Project
- Initialize new Praxis project (domain: write)
- Create Writing Brief (formalize artifact)
- Reference Observe project captures as source material
- Follow Write domain lifecycle (Formalize → Commit → Execute → Sustain)

---

## Learnings from This Observe Project

### What Worked Well
- Daily/near-daily capture maintained momentum (didn't lose context)
- Minimal processing during Capture (lowered friction, captured more)
- Light organization in Sense (themes emerged naturally)
- Connections in Explore (validated patterns across sources)

### What Would Improve Next Time
- Could have tagged captures with preliminary themes (slightly more structure)
- Could have captured questions/gaps explicitly (what still unknown?)
- Could have set an explicit decision point ("revisit after 10 captures")

### When to Use Observe Domain Again
- **Yes:** Research without clear thesis, exploratory reading, brainstorming
- **Yes:** Capturing meeting notes, links, quotes without immediate use
- **No:** When intent is already clear (go straight to appropriate domain)
- **No:** For formal writing or structured learning (use Write/Learn instead)

**Project closed:** 2025-10-16

**Next action:** Create new Write project with formalize artifact (Writing Brief)
