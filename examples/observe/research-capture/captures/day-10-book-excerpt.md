## Highlighted Passage

Page 204:

> "Algorithms need to be held to higher standards than humans, not lower ones. We expect humans to explain their decisions, face consequences when they err, and improve with feedback. Algorithmic systems should do the same—and with their scale and speed, the stakes are higher. An algorithm that makes a thousand biased decisions an hour causes more harm than a single biased human ever could."

## Key Insight (Personal)

- Algorithms should be held to HIGHER standards (because of scale)
- Human accountability = explain + face consequences + improve with feedback
- AI accountability should mirror this (+ scale amplifies harm)
- This is opposite of how many orgs treat AI (lower bar because "it's just an algorithm")

## Connection to Research

- Accountability principle (from Twitter thread)
- Not just "who's responsible?" but "what standards apply?"
- Scale changes the ethics (one biased decision vs. thousand/hour)

**Status:** Raw highlight, strong point about standards
