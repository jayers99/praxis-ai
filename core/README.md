# Core

This directory contains **normative** Praxis definitions.

## Authority
Documents here are **binding**. If there is any conflict with other documentation, `core/` wins.

## Structure
- `spec/` — System specifications (lifecycle, domains, privacy)
- `governance/` — Decision and control surfaces
- `ai/` — AI behavior controls
- `roles/` — Praxis Roles subsystem

## Change Discipline
- Changes require explicit intent
- Semantics take precedence over wording
- See `authority-and-change-control.md` for rules
