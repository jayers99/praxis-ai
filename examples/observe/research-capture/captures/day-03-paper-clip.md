## Citation
Dafoe, A. (2018). AI Governance: A Research Agenda. Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford.

## Key Excerpt (Direct Quote)

> "Effective AI governance requires coordination across multiple layers: technical standards (how systems behave), institutional structures (who decides), and policy frameworks (what's permitted). No single layer is sufficient; they must compose into coherent governance architecture."

## Highlighted Passage

Page 12, Section 3.2:

> "Reversibility and rollback mechanisms are critical. AI systems operating in production must support rapid reversion to prior states when unexpected behaviors emerge. This requires not just technical capability (version control, deployment infrastructure) but organizational processes (decision authority, escalation paths, communication protocols)."

## Personal Notes

- Three layers: technical, institutional, policy
- MUST compose (not just coexist)
- Reversibility = technical + organizational (not just code)
- This aligns with HN thread (multi-layer governance)

## To Explore

- What does "compose into coherent architecture" mean in practice?
- Examples of good composition vs. fragmented governance?
- How do you test governance (like you test code)?
