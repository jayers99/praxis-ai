# Shape Stage Checklist

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Multiple options exist from Explore
- [ ] 2-3 viable directions identified
- [ ] Tradeoffs between options understood

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Single direction chosen
- [ ] Scope roughed out
- [ ] Major tradeoffs resolved
- [ ] Path forward is clear
- [ ] Work remains reversible

## Guidance

Shape is about **convergent thinking**—selecting, refining, and simplifying. You're narrowing from multiple options to a single viable direction.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Evaluate options against constraints
- Make a selection
- Rough out the scope
- Resolve major tradeoffs
- Simplify and refine

**Activities:**
- Option comparison and evaluation
- Tradeoff analysis
- Initial scoping (rough boundaries)
- Feasibility assessment
- Stakeholder input (if applicable)

**Outputs:**
- Single chosen direction
- Rough scope outline
- Major decisions documented
- Clear path forward
- Understanding of what's in/out of scope

**Critical Mindset:**
- **Convergent:** Narrow from many to one
- **Decisive:** Make choices, cut options
- **Pragmatic:** Balance ideal vs. feasible
- **Reversible:** Still safe to change direction

**What Shape Is Not:**
- Detailed specification (that's Formalize)
- Implementation (that's Execute)
- Commitment to build (that's Commit)

## Shape vs. Formalize

Shape answers: **"What direction should we take?"**
Formalize answers: **"What exactly are we building and why?"**

Shape is lightweight and reversible. Formalize locks intent.

## Progression

Once you've chosen a direction and roughed out the scope, advance to **Formalize** to create durable, policy-bearing artifacts.
