# Sense Stage Checklist

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Captured inputs exist
- [ ] Inputs are retrievable and accessible

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Inputs have meaning and context
- [ ] Problem or opportunity can be articulated
- [ ] Basic organization or tagging applied
- [ ] Patterns or themes identified (if applicable)

## Guidance

Sense converts raw inputs into understanding. This is where you add meaning, context, and light organization without committing to action.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Add context to captured inputs
- Tag, summarize, or lightly organize
- Identify patterns or themes
- Articulate the problem or opportunity

**Activities:**
- Light organization (folders, tags, categories)
- Summarization of key points
- Pattern recognition across inputs
- Contextual linking between related inputs

**Outputs:**
- Organized notes with context
- Problem statement or opportunity description
- Initial understanding of the domain
- Connections between related inputs

**What Sense Is Not:**
- Solution generation (that's Explore)
- Commitment to action (that's Shape/Formalize)
- Deep analysis (keep it light and environment-neutral)

## Progression

Once you can articulate the problem or opportunity and understand the inputs, advance to **Explore** to generate possibilities.
