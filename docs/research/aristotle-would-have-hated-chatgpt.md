# Aristotle Would Have Hated ChatGPT

## The Terms

**Telos (τέλος)** — The end, purpose, or goal. Aristotle's "final cause." Everything has a telos; the craftsman's job is to realize it. Intent-maintenance is keeping telos in view while working.

**Proairesis (προαίρεσις)** — Deliberate choice, moral purpose. For the Stoics (Epictetus especially), this is the one thing truly under your control—your capacity to choose in alignment with your values. Intent-maintenance is protecting proairesis from being overwhelmed by externals.

**Akrasia (ἀκρασία)** — Weakness of will. Acting against your better judgment. The failure mode of intent-maintenance—you *know* what you should do but don't do it. Socrates famously denied it existed (if you truly know the good, you'll do it). Aristotle said it's real: you can know and still fail.

**Sophrosyne (σωφροσύνη)** — Temperance, self-control, soundness of mind. The virtue that enables intent-maintenance. Keeping your faculties ordered so purpose isn't hijacked by impulse.

**Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία)** — Flourishing, well-being. The ultimate telos. Intent-maintenance at the life scale—living in accordance with your nature and purpose over time.

## The Connection to Praxis (and Why It's Not Completely Pretentious)

The Praxis problem statement:

> "AI amplifies throughput, not coherence."

Is essentially: **AI accelerates akrasia.**

It lets you act faster than you can maintain proairesis. You generate output before you've clarified purpose. You refine things that aren't defined. You drift scope because scope was never held firmly.

**Formalize is the structural defense against akrasia** — an explicit moment where you articulate telos before execution, so speed doesn't override purpose.

The Greeks would recognize Praxis as a system for **preserving sophrosyne** in the face of a tool that makes akrasia very, very easy.

## The Uncomfortable Implication

If akrasia is "acting against your better judgment," then most AI-assisted work is akrasia by default.

You know you should:
- Define scope before building
- Finish one thing before starting another
- Not let the tool drive the work

But the tool is so fast, so eager, so frictionless that you don't.

The Greeks didn't have ChatGPT, but they understood the problem: **ease erodes discipline**.

Socrates would probably say: "If you truly understood your purpose, you'd stop prompting and go think."

Aristotle would say: "Yeah, but also humans are weak and need systems."

Praxis is the Aristotelian position.

## Why "Praxis" Is Actually the Right Name

πρᾶξις (praxis) in Greek means "action" or "practice" — but specifically *purposeful* action, as distinguished from:
- **Theoria (θεωρία)** — contemplation, pure thought
- **Poiesis (ποίησις)** — making, production

Praxis is action-with-intent. Not just doing, but doing *toward something*.

So the name isn't pretentious. It's accurate.

(The document citing Aristotle to justify the name, however, might be pretentious.)
