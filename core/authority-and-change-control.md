# Authority and Change Control

## Document authority
1. Core (normative)
2. Handoff (operational, must conform to core)
3. Research (explanatory, non-binding)

## Change rules
- Semantic changes require explicit intent
- Research may propose changes but cannot enact them
- Core changes should be versioned

## Agent constraints
Agents may refactor structure but must not alter semantics unless explicitly instructed.
