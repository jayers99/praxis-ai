## Purpose

Theoretical grounding, first principles, and foundational concepts that inform Praxis design decisions. Philosophy, methodology, and cross-cutting concerns.

## Contents

| Title | Consensus | Keywords | Summary |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| [Research Library Design Principles](research-library-design.md) | High | research-library, knowledge-management, findability, zettelkasten | Atomicity, findability via metadata, connections over collections, hybrid retrieval patterns for AI agent knowledge bases |
| [Classical Roots of Praxis-AI](classical-roots.md) | High | philosophy, aristotle, plato, socrates, praxis, phronesis | Direct mapping from Aristotle (Praxis, Phronesis), Plato (Divided Line, Cave), Socrates (Elenchus). AI accelerates akrasia; Praxis is the defense. |
| [Human Intent vs AI Throughput](human-ai-intent-maintenance.md) | Medium | human-ai-collaboration, intent-maintenance, cognitive-load | Academic research validating Praxis problem statement. Comfort-growth paradox, shared representations, dual black box problem. |

## Key Themes

### Philosophy → Framework

The framework's core concepts map directly to classical philosophy:

| Greek Concept | Praxis Implementation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Praxis (purposeful action) | Framework name and Execute/Sustain stages |
| Phronesis (practical wisdom) | Policy Engine: Domain + Stage + Privacy → Behavior |
| Akrasia (weakness of will) | The problem AI amplifies; Formalize defends against it |
| Divided Line (knowledge stages) | Lifecycle stages: Capture → Execute |

### The Core Problem

> AI amplifies throughput, not coherence.

Academic research validates this framing. Praxis provides the operational system that academics haven't yet built.
