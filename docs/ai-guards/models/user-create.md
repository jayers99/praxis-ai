# Create Domain Rules

**User-Level Rules** — Apply to all creative domain projects (design, art, content).

---

## Ideation & Planning

- Work in small, iterative cycles; seek feedback early and often
- Use "Explore" phase before committing to a final direction
- Review existing style guides and brand constraints before starting
- Anchor work with: goal, audience, and core message

---

## Analysis Before Creation

- Understand the medium and its constraints before choosing tools
- Research existing work in the same space to avoid unintentional duplication
- List all required assets and their specifications (size, format, resolution)
- Cannot explain the purpose of a design element? It shouldn't be there

---

## Creative Quality

- Follow established style catalogs and principles
- Prefer clarity and impact over unnecessary complexity
- Keep compositions balanced; use white space and hierarchy effectively
- Preserve brand identity; note deviations explicitly
- Match existing aesthetic patterns when working within a series

---

## Materials & Tools

- Check available materials and tool capabilities before starting
- Prefer sustainable or standard solutions when reasonable
- Justify new tools or expensive materials before acquisition
- Verify tool proficiency before high-stakes execution

---

## Verification & Critique

- Review work against the original goal and audience
- Seek external critique early; don't wait for "perfection"
- Test designs in their final context (e.g., print a proof, view on mobile)
- Mark steps complete only after confirmed review

### Critique Protocol

Format: "Reviewed [asset name] — Result: [APPROVED/REVISE/REJECT]"

---

## Safety & Preservation

- Flag potential copyright or sensitivity issues
- Keep original source files; work non-destructively (layers, versions)
- Pause before irreversible changes: flattening layers, final printing, publishing
- Maintain backups of all creative assets

---

## Versioning & Handoff

- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions for files and versions
- Use granular updates; follow pattern: draft|revision|final|asset|docs
- Organize assets logically; never leave "Untitled" files
- Never finalize without a final review pass

---

## Error Handling & Refinement

- Stop immediately when a technical or aesthetic failure occurs
- Explain reasoning: what isn't working, why, and the proposed fix
- Maintain multiple sketches or concepts; never settle on the first idea
- Distinguish between a tool failure and a design flaw

---

## Quality Gates

- Run spellcheck, accessibility checks, and export tests
- Demand feedback and proofing before final delivery
- Double-check all specifications before production
