**Stage:** Explore  
**Date:** 2025-12-16

## Concept

Authentic vintage poster aesthetic—not overly ornate art deco, but the kind of poster that would have hung in a 1920s speakeasy window. Warm, inviting, slightly mysterious.

---

## Visual Description

**Composition:**
- Balanced but not strictly symmetric (organic vintage feel)
- Champagne toast as focal point (two glasses clinking)
- City skyline silhouette in background (venue context)
- Art deco border, but lighter than Option 1 (decorative, not dominant)

**Typography:**
- Script font for "Louie's" (matches venue logo, personal touch)
- Bold deco sans for "New Year's Eve Celebration"
- Refined serif for details (date, time, address)
- Mixed case (more natural readability than all-caps)

**Color:**
- Black background (mystery, nighttime event)
- Gold for headline and champagne illustration (celebration)
- Burgundy for border and accents (warmth, sophistication)
- Cream for body text (vintage paper feel, readability)

**Ornamentation:**
- Corner flourishes (subtle, not geometric—more organic curves)
- Texture overlay (subtle paper grain, aged feel)
- Thin decorative lines separating sections
- Venue logo integrated into footer naturally

## Strengths

- ✓ Captures speakeasy vibe perfectly (vintage, warm, inviting)
- ✓ Balances elegance with approachability (party, not museum gala)
- ✓ Differentiated aesthetic (not generic NYE, specific to venue)
- ✓ Works for both print (detail rich) and social (strong focal point scales down)
- ✓ Champagne toast visual is immediately celebratory and on-theme

## Weaknesses

- ✗ Slightly more complex execution (illustration + typography + texture)
- ✗ Requires careful balance (could tip into "too busy" if over-designed)

## Client Feedback (Sketch Review)

"This is it! Feels exactly like our venue. The champagne toast is perfect—celebration without being generic. Love the warmth of the burgundy."

**Decision:** ✓ **SELECTED** — Proceed to Shape stage with this direction

**Why this won:** Aligns with brand (vintage speakeasy), captures event tone (celebration + mystery), differentiates from generic NYE graphics, and client responded emotionally ("This is us").
