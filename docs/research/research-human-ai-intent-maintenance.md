# Research: Human Intent vs AI Throughput

**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Context:** Supporting research for Praxis problem statement

## The Praxis Position

> "A practical, operational system for knowledge workers."

AI amplifies throughput, not coherence. The bottleneck moved from production to intent-maintenance. Praxis makes human intent durable enough to survive AI's speed.

## Deep Thinkers in This Space

### 1. Giuseppe Riva — "The Comfort-Growth Paradox" (2025)

**Paper:** _The Architecture of Cognitive Amplification: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding as a Resolution to the Comfort-Growth Paradox in Human-AI Cognitive Integration_

**Citation:** arXiv:2507.19483 [cs.HC]  
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19483

**Key findings:**

- **The paradox:** AI's user-friendly nature fosters intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive friction necessary for development
- **The trap:** AI aligns with user preferences and provides frictionless assistance → induces _cognitive complacency_ rather than growth
- **His solution:** "Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding" — reconceptualize AI from convenient assistant to dynamic mentor with:
  - Progressive autonomy (AI support fades as competence increases)
  - Adaptive personalization
  - Cognitive load optimization

**Relevance to Praxis:** Riva frames the problem academically but doesn't provide operational structure. Praxis's lifecycle stages are a concrete implementation of his "progressive autonomy" concept.

### 2. Ding et al. — "The Diagram is like Guardrails" (2025)

**Paper:** _"The Diagram is like Guardrails": Structuring GenAI-assisted Hypotheses Exploration with an Interactive Shared Representation_

**Citation:** arXiv:2503.16791 [cs.HC]  
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16791  
**Authors:** Zijian Ding, Michelle Brachman, Joel Chan, Werner Geyer

**Key finding:** Shared representations (diagrams) act as guardrails for human-AI collaboration:

- Facilitate structured workflows
- Provide comprehensive overviews
- Enable efficient backtracking
- Reduce cognitive load while maintaining human agency

**Relevance to Praxis:** Validates the SOD/formalization artifact approach. The diagram = shared state that prevents drift. `praxis.yaml` + canonical docs serve the same function.

### 3. Yiming Lu — "Dual Black Box Problem" (2025)

**Paper:** _Deconstructing the Dual Black Box: A Plug-and-Play Cognitive Framework for Human-AI Collaborative Enhancement and Its Implications for AI Governance_

**Citation:** arXiv:2512.08740 [cs.AI]  
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08740

**Key insight:** Identifies the fundamental divide:

- Human "cognitive black box" (implicit intuition)
- AI "computational black box" (untrustworthy decision-making)

Proposes converting both into **auditable, composable "functional white-box" systems** through structured meta-interaction.

**Relevance to Praxis:** The three-layer model (Opinions → Governance → Execution) is essentially this. Praxis makes human intent explicit enough to govern AI output.

## The Gap Praxis Fills

The academic work focuses on:

- Identifying the paradox (Riva)
- Proving shared representations help (Ding)
- Theoretical frameworks (Lu)

**What's missing:** A practical, operational system for knowledge workers. Praxis is that system.

| Academic Concept       | Praxis Implementation                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Comfort-growth paradox | Formalize as friction point            |
| Cognitive scaffolding  | Lifecycle stages                       |
| Shared representation  | praxis.yaml, SOD, canonical docs       |
| Progressive autonomy   | Discovery → Refinement iteration modes |
| Auditable white-box    | Domain + Stage + Privacy → Behavior    |

## Bottom Line

Praxis is ahead of the academics in having a working solution. The research validates the intuition; Praxis operationalizes it.
