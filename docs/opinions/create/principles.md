## TL;DR — Manifesto

Creative work is the discipline of **designing experiences for resonance, clarity, and intentional impact**.

We optimize for:

- Emotional resonance over technical perfection
- Clarity of message over decorative complexity
- Intentionality over accidental discovery
- Iterative refinement over "one-shot" genius
- Audience connection over self-expression

Quality is felt.
Design is a conversation.
Impact comes from focus.

## Purpose of This Document

This document captures the **foundational principles and intellectual influences** that guide how creative work is approached.

It is intentionally:

- Timeless rather than situational
- Advisory rather than binding
- Descriptive of values, not prescriptive of process

This file does **not** define rules, workflows, or enforcement.
Those emerge later through Praxis lifecycle artifacts and formalization contracts.

## Foundational Spine: Design for Impact

**Design for Impact** is the unifying principle across all influences collected here.

> Structure creative work so that the core message or emotion is delivered as clearly and powerfully as possible to the intended audience.

Impact must be:

- Intentional
- Measurable (by response or utility)
- Designed in, not added later

Impact exists at multiple levels:

- **Conceptual** — the "Big Idea" or core message
- **Aesthetic** — the visual or sensory appeal
- **Functional** — how well it serves its purpose
- **Emotional** — the feeling it leaves with the audience
