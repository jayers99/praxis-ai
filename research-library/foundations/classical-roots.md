## Executive Summary

- The name "Praxis" comes directly from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*
- Praxis framework maps to classical philosophy: Theoria (Capture-Explore) → Poiesis (Formalize-Commit) → Praxis (Execute-Sustain)
- **Phronesis** (practical wisdom) → Policy Engine: Domain + Stage + Privacy → Behavior
- **Formalize** stage = Plato's "exit from the cave" — committing to reality from shadows of possibility
- AI amplifies **akrasia** (weakness of will) — acting faster than we can maintain intent; Praxis is the Aristotelian defense

## Consensus Rating

**High**: Direct mapping from canonical philosophical texts. Primary sources (Nicomachean Ethics, Republic, Apology) are unambiguous about these concepts.

## Body

### The Greek Terms

**Telos (τέλος)** — The end, purpose, or goal. Aristotle's "final cause." Everything has a telos; the craftsman's job is to realize it. Intent-maintenance is keeping telos in view while working.

**Proairesis (προαίρεσις)** — Deliberate choice, moral purpose. For the Stoics (Epictetus especially), this is the one thing truly under your control—your capacity to choose in alignment with your values. Intent-maintenance is protecting proairesis from being overwhelmed by externals.

**Akrasia (ἀκρασία)** — Weakness of will. Acting against your better judgment. The failure mode of intent-maintenance—you _know_ what you should do but don't do it. Socrates famously denied it existed (if you truly know the good, you'll do it). Aristotle said it's real: you can know and still fail.

**Sophrosyne (σωφροσύνη)** — Temperance, self-control, soundness of mind. The virtue that enables intent-maintenance. Keeping your faculties ordered so purpose isn't hijacked by impulse.

**Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία)** — Flourishing, well-being. The ultimate telos. Intent-maintenance at the life scale—living in accordance with your nature and purpose over time.

**πρᾶξις (praxis)** — Action or practice—but specifically _purposeful_ action, as distinguished from **theoria** (contemplation) and **poiesis** (making). Praxis is action-with-intent.

### Aristotle — The Direct Source

The name "Praxis" comes directly from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*. Aristotle identified **three fundamental human activities**:

| Greek | Translation | In Praxis-AI |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Theoria** (θεωρία) | Contemplation/theory | Capture, Sense, Explore — "What is this?" |
| **Poiesis** (ποίησις) | Making/production | Formalize, Commit — "Create the artifact" |
| **Praxis** (πρᾶξις) | Action/practice | Execute, Sustain — "Do the work" |

#### Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)

Phronesis (φρόνησις) is the ability to deliberate well about what is good *in particular situations*. It is not abstract knowledge but knowing *what to do here, now*.

**Maps to:** The Policy Engine — deterministic resolution based on context:

```
Domain + Stage + Privacy + Environment → Behavior
```

This formula *is* phronesis operationalized: practical wisdom that resolves context-specific action from general principles.

#### Eudaimonia (Flourishing)

Aristotle's goal was not just doing things but doing them *well* over time — living a flourishing life.

**Maps to:** The **Sustain** stage — active governance of living work, not just completion. Praxis asks: "Does this change alter the contract I formalized, or extend/refine its implementation?"

#### Action as End, Not Means

In praxis (as opposed to poiesis), the activity itself is the goal. The outcome of virtuous action is the action itself, properly done.

**Maps to:** Praxis's emphasis on *durable intent* and *governance* over mere output volume.

---

### Plato — The Stages of Knowledge

Plato's **Divided Line** from the *Republic* maps to Praxis's lifecycle:

| Plato's Stage | Greek | Description | Praxis Stage |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Eikasia** | Imagining | Shadows, reflections, illusion | **Capture** — raw inputs, unexamined |
| **Pistis** | Belief | Perceiving physical objects | **Sense, Explore** — making meaning |
| **Dianoia** | Reasoning | Mathematical/deductive thought | **Shape, Formalize** — structured planning |
| **Noesis** | True Knowledge | Direct apprehension of Forms | **Execute, Sustain** — verified, durable work |

#### The Allegory of the Cave

The journey from shadows to reality — from illusion through education to true understanding.

**Maps to:** The progression from **Capture** (shadows/raw inputs) through **Formalize** (structured understanding) to **Execute** (real work in real world).

**Formalize is the "exit from the cave"** — you commit to a concrete reality, leaving the shadows of undefined possibility.

#### Theory of Forms

Perfect, unchanging ideals that exist behind imperfect material reality.

**Maps to:** **Opinions** in Praxis — timeless principles that guide but don't rigidly bind:

```
Opinions → Governance → Execution
```

---

### Socrates — The Method of Questioning

Socrates's **Elenchus** (method of refutation through questioning) is embedded in Praxis's DNA.

| Socratic Concept | In Praxis |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Aporia** — puzzlement, recognizing ignorance | **Sense stage** — "I don't understand this yet" |
| **Question assumptions** | Stage gates that force explicit decisions |
| **"I know that I know nothing"** | Epistemic honesty in AI Guards |
| **Exposing contradictions** | **Validation model** — errors when artifacts contradict stage |

#### The Examined Life

> "The unexamined life is not worth living."

**Maps to:** The core problem Praxis solves — AI amplifies throughput, not coherence. Without examination (governance), you're "chasing your tail at higher speed."

#### Intellectual Humility

True wisdom begins with recognizing the limits of one's knowledge.

**Maps to:** Stage-appropriate behavior — you cannot "Execute" what you haven't "Formalized." Don't act on what you don't truly know.

---

### The AI Problem: Accelerated Akrasia

The Praxis problem statement:

> "AI amplifies throughput, not coherence."

Is essentially: **AI accelerates akrasia.**

It lets you act faster than you can maintain proairesis. You generate output before you've clarified purpose. You refine things that aren't defined. You drift scope because scope was never held firmly.

**Formalize is the structural defense against akrasia** — an explicit moment where you articulate telos before execution, so speed doesn't override purpose.

The Greeks would recognize Praxis as a system for **preserving sophrosyne** in the face of a tool that makes akrasia very, very easy.

#### The Uncomfortable Implication

If akrasia is "acting against your better judgment," then most AI-assisted work is akrasia by default.

You know you should:
- Define scope before building
- Finish one thing before starting another
- Not let the tool drive the work

But the tool is so fast, so eager, so frictionless that you don't.

The Greeks didn't have ChatGPT, but they understood the problem: **ease erodes discipline**.

Socrates would probably say: "If you truly understood your purpose, you'd stop prompting and go think."

Aristotle would say: "Yeah, but also humans are weak and need systems."

**Praxis is the Aristotelian position.**

---

### The Synthesis

Praxis-AI is a **modern operationalization of classical practical philosophy**:

> **Socrates** asks the questions that expose what we don't know
> **Plato** provides the stages we must ascend through to know truly
> **Aristotle** names the practice itself and provides the framework for wise action

#### The Three Philosophers and the Three Layers

| Philosopher | Contribution | Praxis Layer |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Plato | Eternal principles (Forms) | **Opinions** — Timeless viewpoints that bias decisions |
| Socrates | Critical examination (Elenchus) | **Governance** — The mechanism by which conflicts are resolved |
| Aristotle | Practical action (Praxis/Phronesis) | **Execution** — The work itself, governed by formalization contracts |

#### The Policy Engine as Phronesis

Aristotle's phronesis answers: *Given general principles, what should I do in this particular situation?*

Praxis's Policy Engine does the same:

```
Domain + Stage + Privacy + Environment → Behavior
```

This is phronesis formalized — practical wisdom rendered as a deterministic resolution function.

## Reusable Artifacts

### TL;DR Mapping Table

| Praxis Concept | Classical Root |
|----------------|----------------|
| The name "Praxis" | Aristotle's term for purposeful action |
| Policy Engine | Phronesis — practical wisdom for particular situations |
| Lifecycle stages | Plato's Divided Line — ascent through levels of knowledge |
| Formalize as hinge | Exit from Plato's Cave — committing to reality |
| Opinions layer | Plato's Forms — eternal principles guiding action |
| Governance layer | Socratic Elenchus — systematic examination of assumptions |
| Epistemic honesty | Socrates: "I know that I know nothing" |
| "No execution without formalization" | Don't act on what you don't truly know |
| AI accelerates akrasia | Ease erodes discipline; speed overrides intent |

### Why This Matters for AI-Assisted Work

Classical philosophy grappled with the same core problem Praxis addresses:

> **How do we move from thinking to acting wisely?**

The ancients didn't have AI, but they had the same bottleneck: *intent-maintenance is harder than production*. A sophist could generate endless arguments; a craftsman could produce endless objects. But ensuring those arguments or objects served human flourishing required governance — phronesis, dialectic, examination.

AI amplifies the production side to unprecedented levels. The governance side remains human-limited. Praxis provides the leverage:

- Canonical decisions (no rediscovering rejected ideas)
- Explicit scope boundaries (no endless dialectic)
- Stage gates (forced examination at key moments)

This lets fixed human intent govern unbounded AI output.
