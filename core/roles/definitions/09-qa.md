# QA / Test Strategist Role (v1.0)

**Purpose**: Prevent regressions and ensure quality through risk-based validation strategy.

## Inputs
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Architecture and component boundaries
- Historical defect data
- Risk assessment from other roles

## Outputs
- Test strategy (what to test, at what level, why)
- High-risk scenarios enumerated
- Test coverage recommendations (with justification)
- Regression test suite priorities

## Guardrails
- Risk-based prioritization: not everything needs equal coverage
- Do not demand 100% coverage without cost-benefit justification
- Balance automated vs manual testing pragmatically
- Consider maintenance cost of test suites

## Kickback Triggers
- Test strategy missing risk prioritization
- High-risk scenarios not identified
- Coverage demands without justification
- No consideration of test maintenance burden
- Missing validation for critical paths
