# Film Praxis — AI Slop Guards & Production Charter

**Domain:** Write  
**Subdomain:** opinions / ai-guards  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Status:** Draft (Foundational)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Significant time is spent watching films—often high-quality, canon-defining works (e.g., Criterion Collection)—without producing durable intellectual or creative artifacts. At the same time, increased use of AI introduces the risk of "AI slop": content that is fluent but generic, high-volume but low-authorship, and detached from lived aesthetic judgment.

This project exists to convert film watching into structured output **without sacrificing rigor, authorship, or taste**, while explicitly optimizing AI as a production accelerator rather than a meaning generator.

---

## 2. Core Fear: "AI Slop"

**AI Slop Definition**  
Output that is:
- Generic
- Interchangeable
- Over-confident but under-specific
- Detached from personal judgment
- Easily applicable to any film

In Praxis terms, slop occurs when **AI is allowed to cross lifecycle stages without constraint**, particularly when it originates meaning rather than amplifying intent.

---

## 3. Foundational Praxis Principle

> **AI may amplify intent and structure, but may not originate meaning.**

Meaning—taste, judgment, worldview, interpretation—remains exclusively human-owned.

---

## 4. Praxis Lifecycle Alignment (Human vs AI)

### 4.1 Observe / Consume — *Human Only*
- Watch the film
- Emotional response
- Aesthetic reaction
- Philosophical or ethical resonance

**AI Role:** None  
**Explicit Prohibition:** No summaries, pre-reading, or prompts

---

### 4.2 Capture (Raw) — *Human Only*
- Immediate post-viewing notes
- What lingered
- What failed
- What felt honest or dishonest
- Visual moments recalled (even inaccurately)

**Primary Artifact:** Raw Notes  
**AI Prohibition:** No cleanup, paraphrasing, or organization

This stage establishes *voice*.

---

### 4.3 Shape — *Human-Led, AI-Constrained*

**Human Responsibilities**
- Select one analytical angle
- Choose what is worth pursuing
- Define the tentative claim

**AI Allowed**
- Ask adversarial questions
- Suggest counter-arguments
- Surface formal film-theory vocabulary

**Rule:** AI may challenge, but may not decide.

---

### 4.4 Formalize — *AI-Optimized, Human-Directed*

This stage is where AI provides maximum value with minimal slop risk.

**AI Responsibilities**
- Propose outlines
- Enforce logical structure
- Identify gaps or unsupported claims

**Human Responsibilities**
- Approve the thesis
- Inject worldview and taste
- Reject generic phrasing
- Replace abstractions with specifics

**Primary Artifact**
- Analysis Brief (SOD-style):
  - Claim
  - Evidence
  - Technique
  - Meaning

---

### 4.5 Produce — *AI-Accelerated, Human-Authored*

**AI Can**
- Generate first drafts *from approved outlines*
- Rewrite for clarity or precision
- Compress or expand sections
- Apply formatting

**Human Must**
- Write the opening and closing
- Author all evaluative judgments
- Delete anything that sounds obvious or universal

**Heuristic:** If it could apply to *any* film, it must be removed.

---

### 4.6 Create (Visual Translation) — *Human-Centered*

Photography or illustration derived from:
- One idea
- One frame
- One emotion

**AI Optional**
- Prompt refinement
- Composition critique
- Alternative metaphors

**Rule:** AI never chooses what the image means.

---

### 4.7 Critique & Commit — *Human Gate*

Before publication:
- Does this reflect my taste?
- Would I recognize this without my name attached?
- Is there a non-obvious insight?
- Did AI make this easier, not emptier?

If any answer is **no**, revise or discard.

---

## 5. Anti-Slop Guardrails

### 5.1 Hard Rules
- No AI summaries of films already watched
- No prompts like "explain why this film is good"
- No publishing without a human-written thesis
- Every film must produce **at least one artifact**

---

### 5.2 Quality Tests

- **Specificity Test**: Names scenes, shots, or decisions
- **Taste Test**: Expresses preference and rejection
- **Risk Test**: Makes a falsifiable claim
- **Voice Test**: Cannot be mistaken for generic criticism

---

## 6. Optimized Outcome

**AI Maximizes**
- Speed
- Structural clarity
- Artifact volume

**Human Preserves**
- Meaning
- Judgment
- Artistic identity
- Intellectual rigor

---

## 7. Praxis Charter (One Sentence)

> *This project uses AI to accelerate structure and execution while reserving meaning, taste, and judgment exclusively for the human author.*
