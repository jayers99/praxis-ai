# AI Guards Research

_Topic index for AI instruction files, memory management, and guard design._

## Overview

Research on how to design effective AI instruction files (CLAUDE.md, COPILOT.md, etc.), understanding AI memory constraints, and building composable guard systems.

## Key Concepts

- **AI Memory Model**: Context window constraints, instruction limits (~150-200 max)
- **Guard Composition**: User-level + environment + project-level guards
- **First Principles**: Quality over quantity, earlier > later, simple positive rules
