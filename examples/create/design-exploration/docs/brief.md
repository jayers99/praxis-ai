## 1. Intent & Outcome

### Creative Intent

Design a vintage-inspired New Year's Eve party poster for Louie's speakeasy that captures the venue's art deco aesthetic, communicates event details clearly, and drives advance ticket sales through visual appeal and strategic call-to-action placement.

### Project Context

- Title: Louie's New Year's Eve Celebration Poster
- Client/Venue: Louie's Speakeasy (Downtown)
- Occasion: New Year's Eve 2025 party promotion

### Audience

**Primary:** Local adults 25-45 who appreciate vintage aesthetics, cocktail culture, and upscale nightlife experiences

**Secondary:** Social media users scrolling Instagram/Facebook looking for NYE event options

**What they value:** Authentic vintage atmosphere, sophisticated social experiences, visual aesthetics that signal quality and exclusivity

### Why Now

**Timing:** Event is December 31, 2025. Poster must be print-ready by December 22 (7 days from brief approval) to allow time for printing and venue display. Early promotion drives advance ticket sales at lower price point.

**Opportunity:** Venue's art deco aesthetic is a strong differentiator in crowded NYE event market. Visual design can communicate venue character more effectively than text alone.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

- Print poster design (11x17 portrait format)
- Instagram story variant (9:16 vertical format)
- Visual elements: Champagne toast illustration, city skyline, art deco border
- Typography design for all event information
- Color palette: Gold, black, burgundy, cream
- Vintage paper texture treatment

### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

- Additional social media formats (Facebook cover, square post, etc.)
- Animated or video variants
- Matching ticket design (separate project)
- Merchandise variants (t-shirts, coasters, etc.)
- Print production management (client handles print shop coordination)
- Event photography or additional promotional materials

### Assumptions

- Venue logo files are available in vector format (AI/EPS)
- Client has access to print shop for 11x17 poster production
- Event details (date, time, pricing) are final and won't change
- Instagram story will be posted from venue's official account

### Dependencies

- Venue logo files (vector) — **Status:** Received
- Final event copy approval (date/time/pricing/URL) — **Status:** Confirmed
- Client approval at each iteration checkpoint — **Process:** Established
- Print shop capabilities (metallic gold ink option) — **Status:** Confirmed available

## 3. Constraints

### Brand & Voice

- **Aesthetic:** Vintage art deco (1920s-inspired), not modern retro pastiche
- **Tone:** Elegant and celebratory, mysterious without being exclusive, sophisticated but approachable
- **Authenticity:** Design should feel like preserved vintage poster, not contemporary mimicry
- **Venue alignment:** Must reflect speakeasy character (intimate, upscale, vintage charm)

### Required Elements

- Venue logo (Louie's signature in gold script)
- Event name: "Louie's New Year's Eve Celebration"
- Date: "December 31, 2025"
- Time: "9 PM - 2 AM"
- Address: "123 Main Street, Downtown"
- Ticket pricing: "$35 Advance | $50 Door"
- Ticket URL: "louies.example.com/nye"

### Accessibility & Readability

- Text contrast: Cream on black meets WCAG AA standard (4.5:1 minimum)
- Font size: Minimum 14pt for body text in print version
- Hierarchy: Clear visual distinction between headline, details, and CTA
- Social variant: URL and pricing must be legible on mobile screen (minimum 20pt equivalent)

### Technical Constraints

**Print version:**
- Format: 11x17 inches, portrait orientation
- Resolution: 300 DPI
- Color mode: CMYK (+ Pantone gold metallic callout)
- Bleed: 0.125" on all sides
- File format: Print-ready PDF (PDF/X-1a:2001 standard)

**Instagram story variant:**
- Format: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 aspect ratio)
- Resolution: 72 DPI (screen optimized)
- Color mode: RGB
- File format: PNG or JPEG
- File size: Under 10MB

### Time/Effort Cap

- **Design time:** 12 hours maximum (including revisions)
- **Timeline:** 7 days from brief approval to final files delivery
- **Iterations:** Up to 3 rounds (initial draft, client revision, final polish)
- **Deadline:** Final files delivered by December 22, 5 PM

---

## 4. Execution Framing

### First Deliverable

- **Milestone:** Initial design draft (full composition, 70% polished)
- **Validation:** Does it capture vintage speakeasy vibe? Is hierarchy clear? Does champagne toast work as focal point?
- **Feedback loop:** Client review via PDF proof, written feedback within 24 hours

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Design feels too formal/stiff (gala vs. party) | Medium | High | Emphasize champagne toast warmth, avoid overly geometric ornamentation |
| Gold foil not available/affordable for print | Low | Medium | Design works with standard gold ink; foil is enhancement, not requirement |
| Social variant loses detail when scaled down | Medium | Medium | Simplify border, enlarge URL, test legibility at mobile size during iteration |
| Timeline too tight if multiple revision rounds | Low | High | Lock design direction in first iteration, limit revisions to polish only |

### Open Questions

- Should we mock up the poster in venue context (photo composite)? → **Resolved:** Not required for approval, but nice-to-have if time permits
- Metallic gold ink vs. standard gold (cost difference)? → **Resolved:** Client approved metallic gold, within budget
