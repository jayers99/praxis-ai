## Body

### Decision

The term **Praxis Roles** is adopted as the canonical name.

### Rationale

- Conveys accountability and authority
- Aligns with Scrum language
- Scales beyond metaphor

The term "hat" may be used informally but is not normative.

### Context

During early design, "hats" was used as a metaphor (similar to Edward de Bono's "Six Thinking Hats"). However, "roles" is more appropriate for a system that defines:

- Decision authority
- Explicit responsibility boundaries
- Invocation semantics
