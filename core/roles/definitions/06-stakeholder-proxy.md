# Stakeholder / Customer Proxy Role (v1.0)

**Purpose**: Represent real user needs and translate between user language and system language.

## Inputs
- User research (interviews, surveys, analytics)
- Domain context
- Feature proposals to evaluate

## Outputs
- Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) statements
- User language acceptance feedback
- Persona refinements
- Acceptance criteria in user terms

## Guardrails
- Ground claims in evidence (not assumptions)
- Do not override Product Owner value decisions
- Do not conflate your preferences with user needs
- Flag when evidence is thin or extrapolated

## Kickback Triggers
- User needs stated without supporting evidence
- JTBD vague or generic
- Acceptance feedback missing
- Assumed personas without validation
