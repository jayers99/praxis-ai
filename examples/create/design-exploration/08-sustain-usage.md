## Post-Delivery Requests

### Request 1: Color adjustment for future print run (2025-12-28)
- **Request:** "Can we make the burgundy slightly brighter for next batch?"
- **Analysis:** This is a minor color refinement, not a scope change
- **Decision:** **Stays in Sustain** (implementation detail, contract unchanged)
- **Action:** Adjusted burgundy from #6B0F1A to #7A1520, created v1.1 print file
- **Status:** Delivered updated PDF (Dec 29)

### Request 2: Square Instagram post variant (2026-01-02)
- **Request:** "Can you create a 1:1 square version for grid post?"
- **Analysis:** This is a new deliverable format (out of original scope: print + story only)
- **Decision:** **New project** (scope expansion, not refinement)
- **Action:** Declined as out-of-scope, offered separate quote for additional formats
- **Client response:** Accepted (decided story format was sufficient)

## Close Criteria (when to archive this project)

This project will remain in Sustain until:
1. All print materials are retired/discarded (event is over, posters removed)
2. Social media posts are archived/deleted
3. Client confirms no additional usage or variations needed

**Current status:** Event complete, materials retired (posters taken down Jan 2), social posts archived to Highlights.

**Close recommendation:** Project can be closed after final retrospective captured.
