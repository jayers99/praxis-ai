# Personal Claude Code Instructions

I value directness, minimal changes, and working code over explanations.

## Communication Preferences

- Be direct and concise
- Skip unnecessary preamble
- Provide working code, not explanations of what you could do
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

## Control Signals

- **"Stop"** = halt immediately, wait for instructions
- **"Pause"** = checkpoint progress, summarize state, wait
- **"Clarify"** = I need to understand before you proceed
- Use Plan Mode for non-trivial implementations

## Code Style

- Follow existing project conventions when present
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

## Workflow

- Read before modifying - understand existing code first
- Make minimal changes to accomplish the task
- Run tests after changes when a test suite exists
- Commit messages should be descriptive but concise

## Tools & Environment

- macOS environment
- Prefer standard library solutions when reasonable
- Use project-specified tooling over personal preferences

## Boundaries

- Keep solutions simple and focused on the current problem
- Justify new dependencies before adding them
- Scope changes to the task at hand
- Mark incomplete or placeholder code clearly
