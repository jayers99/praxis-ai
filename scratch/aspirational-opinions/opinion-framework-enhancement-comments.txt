I think the fact that this is a multidimensional matrix should be stated in the core problem first line.

I think the first ticket should be to come up with the defined structure of the opinion folders per domain what does a good set of opinions look like my first

My first thoughts are influencers first principles of influencers consensus, first principles tagged as must have and nice to have

I think the current goal is to break the option framework enhancement into multiple stories

Let's break it down into a series of medium or smaller stories

We could run single agent single threaded through the process to find out what it really looks like and what shape it should take

I think it would be smart to review our life cycle stages and see if they lack in any clarity or can be augmented to provide unambiguous clear instructions clear statements that can be converted by AI into instructions

The same can be said about the domains we should look and see if there's a gap in our current domain definitions that could result in inferior results from this exercise

I think both stage and domain refinement would greatly improve our results from this exercise

I think one of the early tickets should be to define the contract between the opinions, structure, and praxis that will allow us to identify the artifact generated by our multi agent research phase

A separate exercise that describes our opinion generation process for the code domain should be summarized, and each step should be given a value classification and a proper name

Let's separate all multi agent orchestration from this document and keep it in a separate set

I think the first goal take a closer look at the stage definitions rerun through the example of the code domain, generate our first guess of the artifacts that could be used by Praxis and defined that contract between Praxis and aspirational opinions, then validate that against a dummy coading project, I suggest render run
