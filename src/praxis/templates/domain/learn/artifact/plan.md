# Learning Plan

**Domain:** Learn

<!-- This template implements the Formalize Spine from lifecycle.md.
     All five sections are required before proceeding to Commit. -->

---

## 1. Intent & Outcome

<!-- What are you trying to learn? Why now? What will you do with this knowledge?
     Good example: "Learn Kubernetes fundamentals to deploy microservices at work.
     Team is migrating to k8s next quarter, so need working knowledge before
     the migration begins. Success = can deploy and debug a simple service." -->

### Learning Goal

<!-- What specific knowledge or skill are you acquiring? -->

### Why

<!-- What problem does this solve? What opportunity does it unlock? -->

### Why Now

<!-- What makes this timely? Project deadline, career goal, prerequisite? -->

---

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

<!-- What's in, what's out, what are we assuming?
     Good example: In: Core k8s concepts (pods, deployments, services).
     Out: Advanced networking, custom operators. Assumption: Already know
     Docker basics. Dependency: Access to cluster for practice. -->

### In Scope

-

### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

-

### Assumptions

<!-- What prior knowledge or access are you assuming? -->

-

### Dependencies

<!-- Resources, access, or prerequisites this learning depends on -->

-

---

## 3. Constraints

<!-- Boundaries that shape the learning approach.
     Good example: Time: 5 hours/week for 4 weeks. Tools: Must use company's
     GKE cluster. Format: Prefer video + hands-on over reading. -->

### Time Constraints

<!-- Hours per week, total duration, deadline -->

-

### Tooling & Environment

<!-- Required tools, platforms, or access -->

-

### Learning Style Preferences

<!-- Preferred formats, pacing, practice approach -->

-

### Budget/Resource Constraints

<!-- Course costs, book purchases, lab environment costs -->

-

---

## 4. Execution Framing

<!-- How do you start? What could go wrong? What don't you know yet?
     Good example: First milestone: Complete intro course + deploy hello-world.
     Risk: May get stuck on networking concepts. Open question: Which course? -->

### Approach

- Resources (books, papers, courses, docs):
- Experiments / practice:
- Notes format:

### Milestones

<!-- Checkpoints that validate progress. Use concrete deliverables. -->

- Week 1:
- Week 2:

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
|      |            |        |            |

### Open Questions

<!-- Unknowns about approach, resources, or scope -->

-

---

## 5. Commit Criteria

<!-- Unambiguous definition of success. How do you know you've learned it? -->

### Evidence of Learning

<!-- What artifact or demonstration proves mastery?
     Good example: Deploy a multi-container app. Pass certification exam.
     Teach a colleague. Write a blog post explaining the concepts. -->

-

### Success Criteria

<!-- Specific, measurable outcomes.
     Good example: Can deploy from scratch without referring to docs.
     Score 80%+ on practice exam. Complete 3 hands-on labs. -->
