## Project Guards: write

# Write Domain Guards — Technical Article

## Tone and Voice

Technical but accessible:
- Explain concepts clearly without condescension
- Use active voice
- Address the reader directly ("you" not "one")

## Structure

Follow this pattern:
1. Hook (why this matters)
2. Context (what you need to know)
3. Main content (the how-to or explanation)
4. Examples (concrete demonstrations)
5. Summary (key takeaways)

## Code Examples

When including code:
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Include comments for non-obvious parts
- Show both before and after for comparisons
- Test all code examples before publishing

## Style Guidelines

- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Use subheadings for scanability
- Bold key terms on first use
- Link to references and prior art
