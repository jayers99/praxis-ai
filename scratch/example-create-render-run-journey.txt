Brain dump of a user journey that needs to be cleaned up to output a good story short of gherkin, but will be used to identify gaps in specificity so taking one step back before the render stage I have a sample document with the path below of ideas generated for a Christmas card for Darin with a document generated like this I will try and take a stab at a journey that on the other end would result in a brows bowl file system directory containing generated images by the service. See this file below it contains a list of Christmas card ideas.

Next, we would want to take this Marc down file identify all necessary images needed.  I think this file would need to be extended with pointers to locations on the disk of images that would be necessary to execute all the ideas what I'm thinking is these would be global variables because for instance, an example, a three model images that described Darin close enough to get a likeness of him would be usable across all of the ideas so I would think in this case we would have some images of Tino Mima, the grandkids, Izzy, Veronica, Darren, and we would list those at the top and I am not saying that this belongs in the render run command. I don't think it does. I think it belongs in the create domain, but once the user has done the work to collect the necessary images to model each one of the things persons, and then also probably include models of an automate things, and probably would include models of compositions now determining which reference images apply to which ideas would be some work that the user would do and maybe we asked the user To supply those reference references to each one of the ideas then what would happen would be the computer would put together the package for render run and render run would look like the manifest of the idea, name the prompt and then each of the images that it used as reference and then also included in the prompt would be something like image number one is Darren engine image number two is Veronica image number three is Milo then the prompt would reference those image images and probably would reference the image name so that it doesn't get confused and let's say it would have an image name. Blah is a compositional reference and all of those would get captured in the prompt so what should go off to render run prepare would just be The idea metadata around the idea basically the name and something that ties it back to this original document the generated prompt for that idea and then this list of images that have to be uploaded as a part of that prompt to get the right thing out and then I think that's everything that render prepare would need to make the structure document to go against the generator, but let's explore what's missing from that contract from create to render run

Some additional things that rendered prepare would need to know what location it's gonna write it's output to so what I want is the application to have a config file that won all of the different passwords and API keys to access the services to where it's going right it's outputs to and so I want those to be defaulted by a config file inside the render run, but I also want if at one time they want to write to a different output directory they should be able to control that with a switch and I guess probably include the ability to switch using a different API key if they want also and I would assume that the prepare command might put that inside the run manifest we could leave it separate and only include those that information on the generator that would probably make more sense, but I am just exploring possibilities and we can come up with the right decisions after reviewing this brain dump

I think the input for render run needs to be structured or we can leave it up to it to structure it, but the fact that we have to reference images in multiple places maybe to get that done correctly we need to put some more structure around it I say render prepare enforces the structure for the generate and so it should be able to take something pretty loose. It just needs a signal of where in a document is the exact prompt generated so that would mean the logic that lives in create has a template for these ideas of which follow enough structure for render run prepare to course it into a more machine readable structure instead of human readable structure to give to generate initially I'm thinking a list of ideas should have a structure to wear. Prompt is definitely one of the headings in the in the idea and list of reference images is also there and then the unique ID of the idea and also a human readable description of the idea and I think that's the payload we're looking for to so to summarize an idea ID an idea name, an idea, prompt, and idea image references that's my first wag, but we can expand it and clarify and refine
