# Decision Arbitration — Principles, Contracts, and the Formalize Hinge

Version: 0.1.0
Status: Active — Governance Artifact

## Purpose

This document defines **how conflicts are resolved** between:
- Timeless principles
- Context-specific commitments
- The need to execute decisively

It establishes **decision authority**, **override rules**, and **feedback mechanisms** so Praxis remains adaptive without collapsing into dogma or chaos.

This is a governance artifact, not a manifesto or a process checklist.

---

## Influential Lineage

This arbitration model is grounded in the combined thinking of:

- **W. Edwards Deming** — systems thinking, feedback loops, PDCA
- **Dave Farley** — fast feedback, small batches, safe change
- **Eric Evans** — deep problem understanding before commitment
- **Martin Fowler** — continuous refactoring as an enabling mechanism
- **Kent Beck** — fast feedback enables courage
- **The Pragmatic Programmer** — learning before permanence

Deming provides the theoretical backbone:
> Principles are stable. Execution varies. Learning closes the loop.

---

## Core Assertion (Bottom Line)

> **Principles guide. Contracts bind. Formalize arbitrates.**

No single artifact has universal authority.

Tension between principles and execution is **intentional and necessary**.

---

## Authority Hierarchy

Decision authority flows downward and becomes more binding:

```
Principles (advisory, timeless)
        ↓
Praxis Lifecycle (procedural authority)
        ↓
Formalization Contract (binding, contextual)
        ↓
Execution (irreversible work)
```

### Principles
- Timeless
- Advisory
- Bias decisions
- Never enforced mechanically

### Formalization Contracts
- Context-specific
- Explicitly binding
- Enable execution
- May constrain principles temporarily

### Execution
- Irreversible or costly to reverse
- Must operate within the active contract

---

## The Formalize Stage: Arbitration Point

**Formalize** is the explicit decision hinge where tradeoffs are made visible.

At Formalize, the question is:

> “Given our principles, what constraints must we now accept to make progress?”

Formalize exists to:
- Reduce ambiguity
- Freeze selected decisions
- Enable safe execution

It is not bureaucracy; it is intentional commitment.

---

## Principle Overrides (Explicit and Documented)

Principles are not ignored — they are **consciously constrained**.

Each Formalization Contract must include:

### Principles Intentionally Constrained
- Principle name
- Nature of the constraint
- Rationale
- Duration or exit condition

Example:
- *Design for maximal feedback* — constrained to stabilize interfaces for delivery

Overrides are:
- Explicit
- Temporary
- Reviewable

---

## Learning & Feedback Loop (Deming / PDCA)

Every constraint feeds learning back into the system.

```
Plan   → Formalize constraints
Do     → Execute within contract
Check  → Observe outcomes and friction
Act    → Update principles or future contracts
```

Violations, friction, and surprises are **signals**, not failures.

---

## Claude / AI Behavior Expectations

Claude must adapt behavior by lifecycle stage:

### During Explore / Collect
- Favor principles
- Resist premature commitment
- Encourage learning and reversibility

### During Formalize
- Surface tensions explicitly
- Ask which principles are being constrained
- Help articulate rationale

### During Execute
- Respect the active contract
- Do not reopen settled decisions
- Flag only material risk or contradiction

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating principles as immutable rules
- Treating contracts as universal truth
- Allowing execution to silently override principles
- Skipping Formalize and "discovering" constraints mid-build

---

## Status

This document is stable but expected to evolve.

Changes should be:
- Intentional
- Rare
- Backed by observed learning

This file exists to keep Praxis **adaptive, disciplined, and honest**.
